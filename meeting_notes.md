Recap:

Successfully merged the three major feature branches into master (contracts, website, local node).

Notes jotted down during our demo's and discussions

* Store a hash of the submitted paper on the blockchain, to prevent people from duplicating?

* Co-authors as pinners of papers can prevent orphaning of papers on IPFS

* Add co-author addresses who have editing permission to the contract (Donâ€™t add every co-author to prevent bloat of the contract)

* Discussing ideas for pictures for landing pages: "arXain: Distributed Indexing with Distributed Storage"

* Pinning others articles should be fostered, and called "safety pins"

Out standing to-do's:

* Bijan: Incorporate the flask api with submit contract and run an IPFS node on the server

* Khilesh: Contract fixes and connecting them. 

* Khilesh: Image describing arXain

* David: Look over open source documentation, FAQ, assign if things need updating.

* David: incorporate local node pinning and keeping track of pinned items

* Saul: landing page makeover

* All: make a plan for 1517 meeting.

* Transfer to arXain repo and go public

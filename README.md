## Inspiration
Peer review science is critical to modern science, engineering, and healthcare endeavors. However, the system for implementing this process has lagged behind and results in expensive costs for publishing and accessing material, long turn around times reminiscent of snail-mail, and shockingly opaque editorial practices. Astronomy, Physics, Mathematics, and Engineering using a "pre-print server" ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org)) which was the early internets improvement upon snail-mailing articles to researchers around the world. This pre-print server is maintained by a single University, and is constantly requesting donations to keep up the servers and maintenance. While researchers widely acknowledge the importance of the pre-print server, there is no peer review incorporated, and none planned due to technical reasons. Thus, researchers are stuck with spending >$1000 per paper to be published in Journals, all the while individual article access can cost as high as $32 ! ([source](https://www.nature.com/subscriptions/purchasing.html)). For reference, a single PhD thesis can contain >150 references, or essentially cost $4800 if purchased individually.

The recent advance of blockchain and smart contract technology ([Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/)) coupled with decentralized file sharing networks ([InterPlanetaryFileSystem](https://ipfs.io)) naturally lead us to believe that archaic journals and editors could be bypassed. We fashioned our manuscript distribution and reviewing platform based on the arXiv, but in a completely decentralized manner. Users utilize, maintain, and grow the network of scholarship by simply running a simple program and web interface.

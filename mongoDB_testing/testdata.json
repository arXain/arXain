    "summary": "We consider the constraints from Supernova 1987A on particles with small\ncouplings to the Standard Model. We discuss a model with a fermion coupled to a\ndark photon, with various mass relations in the dark sector; millicharged\nparticles; dark-sector fermions with inelastic transitions; the hadronic QCD\naxion; and an axion-like particle that couples to Standard Model fermions with\ncouplings proportional to their mass. In the fermion cases, we develop a new\ndiagnostic for assessing when such a particle is trapped at large mixing\nangles. Our bounds for a fermion coupled to a dark photon constrain small\ncouplings and masses <200 MeV, and do not decouple for low fermion masses. They\nexclude parameter space that is otherwise unconstrained by existing\naccelerator-based and direct-detection searches. In addition, our bounds are\ncomplementary to proposed laboratory searches for sub-GeV dark matter, and do\nnot constrain several \"thermal\" benchmark-model targets. For a millicharged\nparticle, we exclude charges between 10^(-9) to a few times 10^(-6) in units of\nthe electron charge; this excludes parameter space to higher millicharges and\nmasses than previous bounds. For the QCD axion and an axion-like particle, we\napply several updated nuclear physics calculations and include the energy\ndependence of the optical depth to accurately account for energy loss at large\ncouplings. We rule out a hadronic axion of mass between 0.1 and a few hundred\neV, or equivalently bound the PQ scale between a few times 10^4 and 10^8 GeV,\nclosing the hadronic axion window. For an axion-like particle, our bounds\ndisfavor decay constants between a few times 10^5 GeV up to a few times 10^8\nGeV. In all cases, our bounds differ from previous work by more than an order\nof magnitude across the entire parameter space. We also provide estimated\nsystematic errors due to the uncertainties of the progenitor.",

    "summary": "We present theoretical predictions for the production of top-quark pairs in\nassociation with jets at the LHC including electroweak (EW) corrections. First,\nwe present and compare differential predictions at the fixed-order level for $t\n\\bar t$ and $t \\bar t+$jet production at the LHC considering the dominant NLO\nEW corrections of order $\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha_S^2 \\alpha)$ and\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha_S^3 \\alpha)$ respectively together with all additional\nsubleading Born and one-loop contributions. The NLO EW corrections are enhanced\nat large energies and in particular alter the shape of the top transverse\nmomentum distribution, whose reliable modelling is crucial for many searches\nfor new physics at the energy frontier. Based on the fixed-order results we\nmotivate an approximation of the EW corrections valid at the percent level,\nthat allows us to readily incorporate the EW corrections in the MEPS@NLO\nframework of Sherpa combined with OpenLoops. Subsequently, we present multi-jet\nmerged parton-level predictions for inclusive top-pair production incorporating\nNLO QCD+EW corrections to $t \\bar t$ and $t \\bar t+$jet. Finally, we compare at\nthe particle-level against a recent 8 TeV measurement of the top transverse\nmomentum distribution performed by ATLAS in the lepton+jet channel. We find\nvery good agreement between the Monte Carlo prediction and the data when the EW\ncorrections are included.",

    "summary": "The persisting anomalous data in semileptonic B-decays point towards New\nPhysics models exhibiting large sources of Lepton Flavour Universality\nViolation. In this work we generalise previous studies by considering\nframeworks which include an enlarged set of semileptonic four-fermion operators\ninvariant under the SM gauge group, with New Physics affecting mainly the third\ngeneration. We derive the low-energy effective Lagrangian including the leading\nelectroweak corrections, mandatory to obtain reliable predictions. As a\nparticularly interesting case, we analyse the scenario where the dominant New\nPhysics effects are encoded in the Wilson coefficient C_9, as favoured by\nglobal fit analyses of b -> s data. We find that also in this case the\nstringent experimental bounds on Z-pole observables and tau decays challenge a\nsimultaneous explanation of charged and neutral-current non-standard data.",

    "summary": "We compute inclusive electron-nucleus cross sections using ab initio spectral\nfunctions of $^4$He and $^{16}$O obtained within the Self Consistent Green's\nFunction approach. The formalism adopted is based on the factorization of the\nspectral function and the nuclear transition matrix elements. This allows to\nprovide an accurate description of nuclear dynamics and to account for\nrelativistic effects in the interaction vertex. Our calculations use a\nsaturating chiral Hamiltonian in order reproduce the correct nuclear sizes.\nWhen final state interactions for the struck particle are accounted for, we\nfind nice agreement between the data and the theory for the inclusive\nelectron-$^{16}$O cross section. The results lay the foundations for future\napplications of the Self Consistent Green's Function method, in both closed and\nopen shell nuclei, to neutrino data analysis.\n  This work also presents results for the point-proton, charge and\nsingle-nucleon momentum distribution of the same two nuclei. The center of mass\ncan affect these quantities for light nuclei and cannot be separated cleanly in\nmost ab initio post-Hartree-Fock methods. In order to address this, we\ndeveloped a Metropolis Monte Carlo calculation in which the center of mass\ncoordinate can be subtracted exactly from the trial wave function and the\nexpectation values. We gauged this effect for $^4$He by removing the center of\nmass effect from the Optimal Reference State wave function that is generated\nduring the Self Consistent Green's Function calculations. Our findings clearly\nindicate that the residual center of mass contribution strongly modifies\ncalculated matter distributions with respect to those obtained in the intrinsic\nframe. Hence, its subtraction is crucial for a correct description of light\nnuclei.",

    "summary": "We propose a WIMP baryogensis achieved by the annihilation of non-thermally\nproduced WIMPs from decay of heavy particles, which can result in low reheating\ntemerature. Dark matter (DM) can be produced non-thermally during a reheating\nperiod created by the decay of long-lived heavy particle, and subsequently\nre-annihilate to lighter particles even after the thermal freeze-out. The\nre-annihilation of DM provides the observed baryon asymmetry as well as the\ncorrect relic density of DM. We investigate how wahout effects can affect the\ngeneration of the baryon asymmetry and study a model suppressing them. In this\nscenario, we find that DM can be heavy enough and its annihilation cross\nsection can also be larger than that adopted in the usual thermal WIMP\nbaryogenesis.",

    "summary": "Recently, a simple prescription to embed the global Peccei-Quinn (PQ)\nsymmetry into a gauged $U(1)$ symmetry has been proposed. There, explicit\nbreaking of the global PQ symmetry expected in quantum gravity are highly\nsuppressed due to the gauged PQ symmetry. In this paper, we apply the gauged PQ\nmechanism to models where the global PQ symmetry and supersymmetry (SUSY) are\nsimultaneously broken at around $\\mathcal{O}(10^{11-12})$\\,GeV. Such scenario\nis motivated by an intriguing coincidence between the supersymmetry breaking\nscale which explains the observed Higgs boson mass by the gravity mediated\nsfermion masses, and the PQ breaking scale which evades all the astrophysical\nand the cosmological constraints. As a concrete example, we construct a model\nwhich consists of a simultaneous supersymmetry/PQ symmetry breaking sector\nbased on $SU(2)$ dynamics and an additional PQ symmetry breaking sector based\non $SU(N)$ dynamics. We also show that new vector-like particles are predicted\nin the TeV range in the minimum model, which can be tested by the LHC\nexperiments.",

    "summary": "The possibility of linking inflation and late cosmic accelerated expansion\nusing the $\\alpha$-attractor models has received increasing attention due to\ntheir physical motivation. In the early universe, $\\alpha$-attractors provide\nan inflationary mechanism compatible with Planck satellite CMB observations and\npredictive for future gravitational wave CMB modes. Additionally\n$\\alpha$-attractors can be written as quintessence models with a potential that\nconnects a power law regime with a plateau or uplifted exponential, allowing a\nlate cosmic accelerated expansion that can mimic behavior near a cosmological\nconstant. In this paper we study a generalized dark energy $\\alpha$-attractor\nmodel. We thoroughly investigate its phenomenology, including the role of all\nmodel parameters and the possibility of large-scale tachyonic instability\nclustering. We verify the relation that $1+w\\sim 1/\\alpha$ (while the\ngravitational wave power $r\\sim\\alpha$) so these models predict that a\nsignature should appear in either the primordial B-modes or in late time\ndeviation from a cosmological constant. We constrain the model parameters with\ncurrent datasets, including the cosmic microwave background (Planck 2015\ncompressed likelihood), baryon acoustic oscillations (BOSS DR12) and supernovae\n(Pantheon compressed). Our results show that expansion histories close to a\ncosmological constant exist in large regions of the parameter space, not\nrequiring a fine-tuning of the parameters or initial conditions.",

    "summary": "We present a phenomenological study of Dirac electroweakinos in a $U(1)_R$\nextension of the MSSM with a strictly $R$-symmetric Higgs sector (MRSSM) and\ngauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking. One of the distinguishing features of\nthe MRSSM is that the lightest chargino can be lighter than the lightest\nneutralino. Decays from the NLSP chargino to the gravitino LSP will produce\nexotic signals. We apply LHC-13 mass limits from both prompt and long-lived\nsearches to the chargino NLSP regime of the MRSSM. Imposing the additional\nconstraints coming from the 125 GeV Higgs and from the electroweak sector,\nregions of the parameter space are found where the gravitino LSP, chargino NLSP\nscenario survives all current bounds. We also show that the fine-tuning of the\nmodel can reach a level slightly better than sub-percent with our choice of\nparameters.",

    "summary": "We consider a fifth force to be an interaction that couples to matter with a\nstrength that grows with the number of atoms. In addition to competing with the\nstrength of gravity a fifth force can give rise to violations of the\nequivalence principle. Current long range constraints on the strength and range\nof fifth forces are very impressive. Amongst possible fifth forces are those\nthat couple to lepton flavorful charges $L_e-L_{\\mu}$ or $L_e-L_{\\tau}$. They\nhave the property that their range and strength are also constrained by\nneutrino interactions with matter. In this brief note we review the existing\nconstraints on the allowed parameter space in gauged $U(1)_{L_e-L_{\\mu},\nL_{\\tau}}$. We find two regions where neutrino oscillation experiments are at\nthe frontier of probing such a new force. In particular, there is an allowed\nrange of parameter space where neutrino matter interactions relevant for long\nbaseline oscillation experiments depend on the depth of the neutrino beam below\nthe surface of the earth.",

    "summary": "We investigate the radiative decay of the cosmic neutrino background, and its\nimpact on the spectrum of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) that is known\nto be a nearly perfect black body. We derive exact formulae for the decay of a\nheavier neutrino into a lighter neutrino and a photon, $\\nu_j \\to \\nu_i +\n\\gamma$, and of absorption as its inverse, $\\nu_i + \\gamma \\to \\nu_j$, by\naccounting for the precise form of the neutrino momentum distribution. Our\ncalculations show that if the neutrinos are heavier than $\\mathcal O(0.1)$ eV,\nthe exact formulae give results that differ by $\\sim$50%, compared with\napproximate ones where neutrinos are assumed to be at rest. We also find that\nspectral distortion due to absorption is more important for heavy neutrino\nmasses (by a factor of $\\sim$10 going from a neutrino mass of 0.01 eV to 0.1\neV). By analyzing the CMB spectral data measured with COBE-FIRAS, we obtain\nlower limits on the neutrino lifetime of $\\tau_{12} \\gtrsim 4 \\times 10^{21}$ s\n(95% C.L.) for the smaller mass splitting and $\\tau_{13} \\sim \\tau_{23} \\gtrsim\n10^{19}$ s for the larger mass splitting. These represent up to one order of\nmagnitude improvement over previous CMB constraints. With future CMB\nexperiments such as PIXIE, these limits will improve by roughly 4 orders of\nmagnitude. This translates to a projected upper limit on the neutrino magnetic\nmoment (for certain neutrino masses and decay modes) of $\\mu_\\nu < 3 \\times\n10^{-11}\\, \\mu_B$, where $\\mu_B$ is the Bohr magneton. Such constraints would\nmake future precision CMB measurements competitive with lab-based constraints\non neutrino magnetic moments.",

    "summary": "Precise measurement of the Electric Dipole Moment (EDM) and anomalous\nmagnetic moment ($g$-2) of particles is an important test of Beyond Standard\nModel (BSM) physics. It is generally believed that the tau lepton couples more\nstrongly to BSM due to its large mass, but searching for tau EDM and $g$-2 has\nbeen difficult because it is highly unstable and the neutrinos from its decay\nare undetected at collider experiments. A new method to approximately\nreconstruct the neutrinos from the hadronic decays of $\\tau^-\\tau^+$ pairs\nproduced at $e^-e^+$ tau factories is proposed. Using the information from the\nneutrinos, a significant improvement in the related measurements can be\nachieved. With the matrix element technique, and the estimated 50 ab$^{-1}$ of\ndata to be delivered by the $Belle$-II experiment, a tau EDM search with a\n1-$\\sigma$ level precision of $|d_\\tau|<2.09\\times 10^{-19}$ e$\\cdot$cm, and\n$g$-2 search with $|\\Delta a_\\tau|<1.80\\times 10^{-5}$ ($1.5\\%$ of the SM\nprediction), can be expected.

    "summary": "Higher Fourier harmonics of anisotropic flow ($v_4$ and beyond) get large\ncontributions induced by elliptic and triangular flow through nonlinear\nresponse. We present a general framework of nonlinear hydrodynamic response\nwhich encompasses the existing one, and allows to take into account the mutual\ncorrelation between the nonlinear couplings affecting Fourier harmonics of any\norder. Using Large Hadron Collider data on Pb+Pb collisions at\n~$\\sqrt[]{s}=2.76$ TeV, we perform an application of our formalism to hexagonal\nflow, $v_6$, a coefficient affected by several nonlinear contributions which\nare of the same order of magnitude. We obtain the first experimental measure of\nthe coefficient $\\chi_{624}$, which couples $v_6$ to $v_2$ and $v_4$. This is\nachieved by putting together the information from several analyses: event-plane\ncorrelations, symmetric cumulants, as well as new higher-order moments recently\nanalyzed by the ALICE collaboration. The value of $\\chi_{624}$ extracted from\ndata is in fair agreement with hydrodynamic calculations, although with large\nerror bars, which would be dramatically reduced by a dedicated analysis. We\nargue that within our formalism the nonlinear structure of a given higher\nharmonic can be determined more accurately than the harmonic itself, and we\nemphasize potential applications to future measurements of $v_7$ and $v_8$.",

    "summary": "A variety of new-physics models predict metastable particles whose decay\nlength is $\\lesssim 1$ mm. Conventional displaced-vertex searches are less\nsensitive to this sub-millimeter decay range, and thus such metastable\nparticles have been looked for only in usual prompt decay searches. In this\npaper, we show that an additional event-selection cut based on the vertex\nreconstruction using charged tracks considerably improves the sensitivity of\nordinary searches which rely only on kinematic selection criteria, for\nparticles with a decay length of $\\gtrsim 100$ $\\mu \\text{m}$. To that end, we\nconsider a metastable gluino as an example, and study the impact of this new\nevent-selection cut on gluino searches at the LHC by simulating both the signal\nand Standard Model background processes. Uncertainty of the displaced-vertex\nreconstruction due to the limited resolution of track reconstruction is taken\ninto account. We also discuss possibilities for optimization of the kinematic\nselection criteria, which takes advantage of significant reduction of\nbackground through the requirement of displaced vertices. In addition, we\ndemonstrate that using the method discussed in this paper it is possible to\nmeasure the lifetime of metastable particles with an ${\\cal O}(1)$ accuracy at\nthe high-luminosity LHC. Implications for a future 100 TeV collider are also\nstudied, where produced particles tend to be more boosted and thus it is easier\nto detect the longevity of metastable particles.",

    "summary": "Given observations of B-mode polarization power spectrum of the cosmic\nmicrowave background (CMB), we can reconstruct power spectra of primordial\ntensor modes from the early Universe without assuming their functional form\nsuch as a power-law spectrum. Shape of the reconstructed spectra can then be\nused to probe the origin of tensor modes in a model-independent manner. We use\nthe Fisher matrix to calculate the covariance matrix of tensor power spectra\nreconstructed in bins. We find that the power spectra are best reconstructed at\nwavenumbers in the vicinity of $k\\approx 6\\times 10^{-4}$ and $5\\times\n10^{-3}~{\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$, which correspond to the \"reionization bump\" at\n$\\ell\\lesssim 6$ and \"recombination bump\" at $\\ell\\approx 80$ of the CMB B-mode\npower spectrum, respectively. The error bar between these two wavenumbers is\nlarger because of lack of the signal between the reionization and recombination\nbumps. The error bars increase sharply towards smaller (larger) wavenumbers\nbecause of the cosmic variance (CMB lensing and instrumental noise). To\ndemonstrate utility of the reconstructed power spectra we investigate whether\nwe can distinguish between various sources of tensor modes including those from\nthe vacuum metric fluctuation and SU(2) gauge fields during single-field\nslow-roll inflation, open inflation and massive gravity inflation. The results\ndepend on the model parameters, but we find that future CMB experiments are\nsensitive to differences in these models. We make our calculation tool\navailable on-line.",

A finality of this work is to\nunderline the modifications carried out by the color superconducting regime on\nthe used equations and on the obtained results. It has been observed that the\ntwo-flavor color-superconducting (2SC) phase affects the masses of the mesons\nand diquarks in a non-negligible way. This observation is particularly true at\nhigh densities and low temperatures for the pions, $\\eta$ and the diquarks [ud]\nwhose color is rg.

    "summary": "Many Standard Model extensions that address the hierarchy problem contain\nDirac-fermion partners of the top quark, which are typically expected around\nthe TeV scale. Searches for these vector-like quarks mostly focus on their\ndecay into electroweak gauge bosons and Higgs plus a standard model quark. In\nthis article, backed by models of composite Higgs, we propose a set of\nsimplified scenarios that include more exotic decay channels, which modify the\nsearch strategies and affect the bounds. Analysing several classes of\nunderlying models, we show that exotic decays are the norm and commonly appear\nwith significant rates. All these models contain light new scalars that couple\nto top partners with charge $5/3$, $2/3$, and $-1/3$. We identify the\ncontributing particle content and novel top partner decays that occur most\ncommonly, provide effective Lagrangians, benchmarks, and a brief discussion of\nthe phenomenological bounds and the newly occurring final states. In the second\npart of the article, we provide details on the underlying models and underlying\nparameters that yield the benchmark points used in our phenomenological\ndiscussion.",

    "summary": "New QCD-like `hypercolor' sectors can generate a broad class of new\nsignatures at hadron colliders and furnish a variety of dark matter candidates.\nPaired diboson resonances are a particularly important collider signature,\narising both from $CP$-conserving vector hypermeson decays of the form\n$\\widetilde\\rho \\rightarrow\\widetilde\\pi\\widetilde\\pi\\rightarrow 4V$ and from\n$CP$-violating pseudoscalar hypermeson decays of the form\n$\\widetilde\\eta\\rightarrow \\widetilde\\pi\\widetilde\\pi\\rightarrow 4V$. The\nlatter are sensitive to the vacuum angle $\\widetilde \\theta$ in the hypercolor\nsector. We study single- and paired-diboson resonance signatures in final\nstates involving gluons and photons at the LHC and a future 100 TeV $pp$\ncollider, illustrating the discovery potential at both colliders in simple\nbenchmark models. We also describe some of the theoretical and cosmological\nconsequences of $\\widetilde \\theta$. If $CP$-violating hypermeson decays are\nobservable at hadron colliders, ordinary QCD must have an axion. Such scenarios\nalso provide a natural setting for a dark pion component of dark matter, with\nits relic abundance set by $CP$-violating annihilations. If the new vacuum\nangle is relaxed to zero by a dark axion, the relic density can instead be a\nmixture of axions and dark axions. Overproduction of dark axions is most easily\navoided if the universe underwent a period of early matter domination.",

    "summary": "Current searches for the light top squark (stop) mostly focus on the decay\nchannels of $\\tilde{t} \\rightarrow t \\chi_1^0$ or $\\tilde{t} \\rightarrow b\n\\chi_1^\\pm \\rightarrow bW \\chi_1^0$, leading to $t\\bar{t}/bbWW+\\met$ final\nstates for stop pair productions at the LHC. However, in supersymmetric\nscenarios with light neutralinos and charginos other than the neutralino\nlightest supersymmetric particle (LSP), more than one decay mode of the stop\ncould be dominant. While those new decay modes could significantly weaken the\ncurrent stop search limits at the LHC, they also offer alternative discovery\nchannels for stop searches. In this paper, we studied the scenario with light\nHiggsino next-to-LSPs (NLSPs) and Bino LSP. The light stop decays primarily via\n$\\tilde t_1 \\to t \\chi_2^0/\\chi_3^0$, with the neutralinos subsequent decaying\nto a $Z$ boson or a Higgs boson: $\\chi_2^0/\\chi^0_3 \\to \\chi_1^0 h/Z$. Pair\nproduction of light stops at the LHC leads to final states of $t \\bar t\nhh\\met$, $t \\bar t hZ\\met$ or $t \\bar t ZZ\\met$. We consider three signal\nregions: one charged lepton (1$\\ell$), two opposite sign charged leptons (2 OS\n$\\ell$) and at least three charged leptons ($ \\ge 3 \\ell$). We found that the\n1$\\ell$ signal region of channel $t \\bar t hZ\\met$ has the best reach\nsensitivity for light stop searches. For 14 TeV LHC with 300 ${\\rm fb}^{-1}$\nintegrated luminosity, a stop mass up to 900 GeV can be discovered at 5$\\sigma$\nsignificance, or up to 1050 GeV can be excluded at 95\\% C.L. Combining all\nthree decay channels for $1 \\ell$ signal region extends the reach for about\n100$-$150 GeV.

    "summary": "The computation of observables in general interacting theories, be them\nquantum mechanical, field, gauge or string theories, is a non-trivial problem\nwhich in many cases can only be addressed by resorting to perturbative methods.\nIn most physically interesting problems these perturbative expansions result in\nasymptotic series with zero radius of convergence. These asymptotic series then\nrequire the use of resurgence and transseries in order for the associated\nobservables to become nonperturbatively well-defined. Resurgence encodes the\ncomplete large-order asymptotic behaviour of the coefficients from a\nperturbative expansion, generically in terms of (multi) instanton sectors and\nfor each problem in terms of its Stokes constants. Some observables arise from\nlinear problems, and have a finite number of instanton sectors and associated\nStokes constants; some other observables arise from nonlinear problems, and\nhave an infinite number of instanton sectors and Stokes constants. By means of\ntwo very explicit examples, and with emphasis on a pedagogical style of\npresentation, this work aims at serving as a primer on the aforementioned\nresurgent, large-order asymptotics of general perturbative expansions. This\nincludes discussions of transseries, Stokes phenomena, generalized\nsteepest-descent methods, Borel transforms, nonlinear resonance, and alien\ncalculus. Furthermore, resurgent properties of transseries---usually described\nmathematically via alien calculus---are recast in equivalent physical\nlanguages: either a \"statistical mechanical\" language, as motions in chains and\nlattices; or a \"conformal field theoretical\" language, with underlying\nVirasoro-like algebraic structures.",

    "summary": "The extragalactic $\\gamma$-ray background (EGB) arises from accumulation\n$\\gamma$-ray emissions from resolved and unresolved extragalactic sources as\nwell as diffuse processes.

We\nexplore the correlation of the EGB from Fermi-LAT data with the large-scale\nmatter density distribution from the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) SSP survey.\nWe reconstruct an unbiased surface matter density distribution $\\kappa$ at\n$z<1$ by applying weak-gravitational lensing analysis to the first-year HSC\ndata. We then calculate the $\\kappa - \\gamma$ cross-correlation. Our\nmeasurement suggests overall weak correlation at angular scales of 30-60\narcmin. The result is essentially consistent with a null detection, and allows\nus to derive constraints on the statistical relationships between astrophysical\n$\\gamma$-ray sources and dark matter halos.

    "summary": "The increasing statistics of the high-energy neutrino flux observed by the\nIceCube Observatory points towards an excess of events above the atmospheric\nneutrino background in the 30--400 TeV energy range. Such an excess is\ncompatible with the findings of the ANTARES Telescope and it would naturally\nimply the possibility that more than one source class contributes to the\nobserved flux. Electromagnetically hidden sources have been invoked to\ninterpret this excess of events at low energies. By adopting a unified model\nfor the electromagnetically bright and choked gamma-ray bursts and taking into\naccount particle acceleration at the internal and collimation shock radii, we\ndiscuss whether bright and choked bursts are viable candidates. Our findings\nsuggest that, although producing a copious neutrino flux, choked and bright\nastrophysical jets cannot be the dominant sources of the excess of neutrino\nevents. A fine tuning of the model parameters or distinct scenarios for choked\njets should be invoked in order to explain the low-energy neutrino data of\nIceCube and ANTARES.",

    "summary": "The two-loop interaction correction coefficient to the universal ac\nconductivity of disorder-free intrinsic graphene is computed with the help of a\nfield theoretic renormalization study using the BPHZ prescription. Non-standard\nWard identities imply that divergent subgraphs (related to Fermi velocity\nrenormalization) contribute to the renormalized optical conductivity.\nProceeding either via density-density or via current-current correlation\nfunctions, a single well-defined value is obtained: $\\mathcal{C}= (19-6\\pi)/12)\n= 0.01$ in agreement with the result first obtained by Mishchenko and which is\ncompatible with experimental uncertainties.",

    "summary": "Higher-order corrections to the Higgs-boson masses within the MSSM are\ndesirable for accurate predictions currently testable at the LHC. From the\ncomparison of the prediction with the measured value of the mass of the\ndiscovered Higgs signal, constraints on the available parameter space can be\ninferred. In order to improve on the accuracy of current predictions, all\ntwo-loop corrections involving the strong coupling are computed for the\nHiggs-boson mass spectrum of the MSSM with complex parameters. Apart from the\ndependence on the strong coupling, these contributions depend on the weak\ncoupling, leading to terms of $\\mathcal{O}{\\left(\\alpha\\alpha_s\\right)}$, or on\nYukawa couplings, leading to terms of\n$\\mathcal{O}{\\left(\\sqrt{\\alpha_{q_1}}\\sqrt{\\alpha_{q_2}}\\alpha_s\\right)}$,\n($q_{1,2}=t,b,c,s,u,d$; flavor-violation effects are neglected). The full\ndependence on the external momentum at the two-loop level and on all relevant\nmass scales is taken into account. The calculation is performed in the\nFeynman-diagrammatic approach such that there is flexibility in the choice of\nthe employed renormalization scheme. For the phenomenological results presented\nhere, a renormalization scheme consistent with higher-order corrections\nincluded in the code FeynHiggs is adopted. For the evaluation of the results, a\ntotal of 513 two-loop two-point integrals with up to five different mass scales\nare computed fully numerically using the program SecDec. A comparison with\nexisting results in the limit of real parameters and / or vanishing external\nmomentum is carried out, and the impact of the new results for the lightest\nneutral Higgs-boson mass of the MSSM is discussed with respect to their\ndependence on the phases of the complex parameters. The new results will be\nincluded in the public code FeynHiggs.",

    "summary": "We have investigated the production potential of the spin-1/2 excited muons,\npredicted by the preonic models, at the four SPPC (Super Proton-Proton\nCollider)-based muon-proton colliders in different center-of-mass energies. For\nthe signal process \\mu p\\rightarrow\\mu^{\\star}X\\rightarrow\\mu\\gamma X, the\nproduction cross-section and the decay width values of the excited muons have\nbeen calculated. The pseudorapidity and transverse momentum distributions of\nthe final state particles of muons and photons have been obtained to be\ndetermine the kinematical cuts best suited for discovery of the excited muons.\nBy applying these cuts we have gotten the discovery, observation and exclusion\nmass limits of the excited muons for two compositeness scale values. It is\nshown that the discovery limits on the excited muons in case the compositeness\nscale equals to 100 TeV are 2.7, 3.9, 3.1 and 6.7 TeV for center-of-mass\nenergies of 10.3, 14.2, 14.6 and 20.2 TeV, respectively.",

In the first phase,\nthe experiment will be operated at an existing intense muon beam line at the\nPaul Scherrer Institute. With muon stopping rates of about\n$10^{8}\\text{s}^{-1}$, a single-event sensitivity of $2\\cdot 10^{-15}$ can be\nachieved. For the ultimate sensitivity, a new high intensity muon beam line is\nrequired. In order to suppress background, the tracking detector is designed to\nmeasure low momentum electron and positron tracks with excellent precision by\nmaking use of very thin silicon pixel sensors. In addition, scintillating\nfibres and tiles provide precise timing information. Currently, the\ncollaboration is finalizing the detector design and preparing for construction\nand commissioning.",

These parameters get additional\ncontributions in the minimal supersymmetric model,(MSSM). A variation in $m_s$\nwill influence the bounds for which the Standard Model,(SM) and MSSM work and\nhence will account for the different radiative contributions received from both\nsectors respectively, while running the renormalization group equations,(RGE).\nThe present work establishes the invariance of the self complementarity\nrelation among the three mixing angles,\n$\\theta_{13}+\\theta_{12}\\approx\\theta_{23}$ against the radiative evolution. A\nsimilar result concerning the mass ratio, $m_2: m_1$ is also found to be valid.\nIn addition to varying $m_s$, the work incorporates a range of different\nseesaw\\,(SS) scales and tries to see how the latter affects the parameters.",

    "summary": "Hadronic freezeout during the evolution of the medium created in heavy-ion\ncollisions is an important phenomena. It is quite useful to find a universal\nfreezeout condition for each and every nuclear collisions. In this article, we\nhave constructed a hybrid model to calculate the ratio of transverse energy to\ntotal mean multiplicity $E_{T} /N_{ch}$, since this ratio can possibly act as a\nfreezeout condition in heavy-ion collision experiments. Present hybrid model\nblends two approaches : Tsallis statistics and wounded quark approach.\nRecently, Tsallis statistics has been reliably used to obtain the transverse\nmomentum distribution of charged hadrons produced in relativistic ion\ncollisions. On the other side it has been shown that the pseudorapidity\ndistribution of charged hadrons can be calculated satisfactorily using the\nwounded quark model (WQM). We have used this hybrid model to calculate the\ntransverse energy density distributions, $dE_{T}/d\\eta$ at midrapidity using\ncharged particle pseudorapidity distributions, $dN_{ch}/d\\eta$ and mean\ntransverse momentum $\\langle p_{T} \\rangle$ in various type of nuclear\ncollisions. We found that present hybrid model satisfactorily explains the\nexperimental data whether other models fail to reproduce the data at central\nand at peripheral collisions simultaneously. Finally, ratio of transverse\nenergy to total mean multiplicity, $E_{T} /N_{ch}$ has been computed within\nhybrid model and compared with the available experimental data at RHIC and LHC\nenergies. We observed no explicit dependence of $E_{T} /N_{ch}$ on energy as\nwell as centrality and thus it can definitely act as a freezeout criteria.",

    "summary": "Through the embedding of superconformal quantum mechanics into AdS space, it\nis possible to construct an effective supersymmetric QCD light-front\nHamiltonian for hadrons, which includes a spin-spin interaction between the\nhadronic constituents. A specific breaking of conformal symmetry determines a\nunique effective quark-confining potential for light hadrons, as well as\nremarkable connections between the meson, baryon, and tetraquark spectra. The\npion is massless in the chiral limit and has no supersymmetric partner. The\nexcitation spectra of relativistic light-quark meson, baryon and tetraquark\nbound states lie on linear Regge trajectories with identical slopes in the\nradial and orbital quantum numbers. Although conformal symmetry is strongly\nbroken by the heavy quark mass, the basic underlying supersymmetric mechanism,\nwhich transforms mesons to baryons (and baryons to tetraquarks) into each\nother, still holds and gives remarkable connections across the entire spectrum\nof light, heavy-light and double-heavy hadrons. Here we show that all the\nobserved hadrons can be related through this effective supersymmetric QCD, and\nthat it can be used to identify the structure of the new charmonium states.",

    "summary": "The Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) -- the separation of positive and negative\nelectric charges along the direction of the external magnetic field in\nquark-gluon plasma and other topologically non-trivial media -- is a\nconsequence of the coupling of electrodynamics to the topological gluon field\nfluctuations that form metastable $CP$-odd domains. In phenomenological models\nit is usually assumed that the domains are uniform and the influence of the\ndomain walls on the electric current flow is not essential. This paper\nchallenges the latter assumption. A simple model consisting of a uniform\nspherical domain in a uniform time-dependent magnetic field is introduced and\nanalytically solved. It is shown that (i) no electric current flows into or out\nof the domain, (ii) the charge separation current, viz. the total electric\ncurrent flowing inside the domain in the external field direction, is a\ndissipative Ohm current, (iii) the CME effect can be produced either by the\nanomalous current or by the boundary conditions on the domain wall and (iv) the\ncharge separation current oscillates in plasma long after the external field\ndecays. These properties are qualitatively different from the CME in an\ninfinite medium.",

    "summary": "We compute the differential cross-section for inclusive prompt photon\nproduction in deeply inelastic scattering (DIS) of electrons on nuclei at small\n$x$ in the framework of the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) effective theory. The\nleading order (LO) computation in this framework resums leading logarithms in\n$x$ as well as power corrections to all orders in $Q_{s,A}^2/Q^2$, where\n$Q_{s,A}(x)$ is the nuclear saturation scale. This LO result is proportional to\nuniversal dipole and quadrupole Wilson line correlators in the nucleus. In the\nsoft photon limit, the Low-Burnett-Kroll theorem allows us to recover existing\nresults on inclusive DIS dijet production. The $k_{\\perp}$ and collinearly\nfactorized expressions for prompt photon production in DIS are also recovered\nin a leading twist approximation to our result. In the latter case, our result\ncorresponds to the dominant next-to-leading order (NLO) perturbative QCD\ncontribution at small $x$. We next discuss the computation of the NLO\ncorrections to inclusive prompt photon production in the CGC framework. In\nparticular, we emphasize the advantages for higher order computations in\ninclusive photon production, and for fully inclusive DIS, arising from the\nsimple momentum space structure of the dressed quark and gluon \"shock wave\"\npropagators in the \"wrong\" light cone gauge $A^-=0$ for a nucleus moving with\n$P^{+}_{N} \\rightarrow \\infty$.",

    "summary": "For more than forty years virtually all work on the theory of type Ia\nSupernovae (SN Ia) has assumed that these explosions were due to the transfer\nof mass to a degenerate star from a partner in a binary system. In these binary\nmodels, when the mass of one partner closely approaches the Chandrasekhar\nmaximum for a stable degenerate system, fusion can be initiated and the star\nexplodes. However, there are now a number of indications that fusion could\ninstead be triggered by a phase transition in a sub-Chandrasekhar white dwarf\nstar. Although these indications provide no clue as to what specific phase\ntransition initiates the explosion, it is possible that remarkable and well\nestablished host galaxy effects as considered in the present work could point\nto a specific source of the energy deposition. These host galaxy correlations\nare, at first glance, surprising since the typical distance scale of white\ndwarf stars is the earth radius while the typical distance between stars is at\nthe light year scale. Performing a least $\\chi^2$ fit to the delay time\ndistribution to fix parameters, we give predictions from the susy phase\ntransition model for the host galaxy effects. In addition we discuss a susy\ninsight into the Phillips relation which is basic to the cosmological\nimportance of the type Ia supernovae.",

Here we consider a model of neutrino splitting\n$\\nu\\rightarrow 3 \\nu$ over cosmological distances. Starting from a single\npower-law spectrum expected from the astrophysical sources, we show that by\nadjusting the decay length and spectral index one can give a better fit to the\nobserved IceCube events over the entire 1 TeV -6 PeV, compared to that from a\nsingle power spectrum. For $\\nu\\rightarrow 3\\nu$ neutrino splitting, the flavor\nratios of the daughter neutrinos are different from the standard oscillation or\ninvisible decay cases and can be used as a test of this scenario. We propose a\n$\\nu2HDM$ where a light Higgs ($\\sim 0.1 $ \\, eV) mediates neutrino splitting\nvia a one-loop box diagram. The split in the masses of the scalars in the\ndoublet gives a large contribution to the oblique T parameter which is severely\nconstrained. This constraint from the S,T,U oblique parameters can be evaded by\nthe introduction of an extra vector lepton doublet and with mass $\\sim 200$\nGeV.",

    "summary": "Given the precision of current neutrino data, priors still impact noticeably\nthe constraints on neutrino masses and their hierarchy. To avoid our\nunderstanding of neutrinos being driven by prior assumptions, we construct a\nprior that is mathematically minimally informative. Using the constructed\nuninformative prior, we find that the normal hierarchy is favoured but with\ninconclusive posterior odds of 5.1:1. Better data is hence needed before the\nneutrino masses and their hierarchy can be well constrained. We find that the\nnext decade of cosmological data should provide conclusive evidence if the\nnormal hierarchy with negligible minimum mass is correct, and if the\nuncertainty in the sum of neutrino masses drops below 0.025 eV. On the other\nhand, if neutrinos obey the inverted hierarchy, achieving strong evidence will\nbe difficult with the same uncertainties. Our uninformative prior was\nconstructed from principles of the Objective Bayesian approach. The prior is\ncalled a reference prior and is minimally informative in the specific sense\nthat the information gain after collection of data is maximised. The prior is\ncomputed for the combination of neutrino oscillation data and cosmological data\nand still applies if the data improve.",

While for a positive coupling to the\nHiggs field the dark scalar is stable, for a negative coupling it acquires a\nvacuum expectation value after the electroweak phase transition and may decay\ninto photon pairs, albeit with a mean lifetime much larger than the age of the\nUniverse. We explore possible astrophysical and laboratory signatures of such a\ndark matter candidate in both cases, including annihilation and decay into\nphotons, Higgs decay, photon-dark scalar oscillations and induced oscillations\nof fundamental constants. We find that dark matter within this scenario will be\ngenerically difficult to detect in the near future, except for the promising\ncase of a 7 keV dark scalar decaying into photons, which naturally explains the\nobserved galactic and extra-galactic 3.5 keV X-ray line.",

    "summary": "A search for a new heavy particle decaying to a pair of vector bosons (WW or\nWZ) is presented using data from the CMS detector corresponding to an\nintegrated luminosity of 35.9 fb$^{-1}$ collected in proton-proton collisions\nat a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV in 2016. One of the bosons is required to\nbe a W boson decaying to e$\\nu$ or $\\mu\\nu$, while the other boson is required\nto be reconstructed as a single massive jet with substructure compatible with\nthat of a highly-energetic quark pair from a W or Z boson decay. The search is\nperformed in the resonance mass range between 1.0 and 4.5 TeV. The largest\ndeviation from the background-only hypothesis is observed for a mass near 1.4\nTeV and corresponds to a local significance of 2.5 standard deviations. The\nresult is interpreted as an upper bound on the resonance production cross\nsection. Comparing the excluded cross section values and the expectations from\ntheoretical calculations in the bulk graviton and heavy vector triplet models,\nspin-2 WW resonances with mass smaller than 1.07 TeV and spin-1 WZ resonances\nlighter than 3.05 TeV, respectively, are excluded at 95% confidence level.",

Beyond the Standard Model we include new vector and axial-vector\noperators, scalar and pseudo-scalar operators, and tensor operators in the\neffective Hamiltonian. Working in the helicity basis and using appropriate\nparametrization of the $\\Lambda_b \\to \\Lambda$ hadronic matrix elements, we\ngive expressions of hadronic and leptonic helicity amplitudes and derive\nexpression of double differential branching ratio with respect to dilepton\ninvariant mass squared and cosine of lepton angle. Appropriately integrating\nthe differential branching ratio over the lepton angle, we obtain the\nlongitudinal polarization fraction and the leptonic forward-backward asymmetry\nand sequentially study the observables in the presence of the new couplings. To\nanalyze the implications of the new vector and axial-vector couplings, we\nfollow the current global fits to $b\\to s\\mu^+\\mu^-$ data. While the impacts of\nscalar couplings can be significant, exclusive $\\bar{B}\\to X_s\\mu^+\\mu^-$ data\nimply stringent constraints on the tensor couplings and hence the effects on\n$\\Lambda_b\\to\\Lambda\\mu^+\\mu^-$ is negligible.",

If axions exist\nand have low mass, they are a candidate for dark matter as well. So far our\nknowledge of the properties of the QCD axion rests on semi-classical arguments\nand effective theory. In this Letter we perform a fully dynamical investigation\nof the Peccei-Quinn theory, focussing on the impact of QCD on key axion\nparameters, by simulating the Peccei-Quinn-Weinberg-Wilczek action on the\nlattice. The results of the simulation, including the axion mass and effective\npotential, are found to be in contradiction with current axion phenomenology\nand question the validity and use of the Peccei-Quinn theory.",

    "summary": "We study inflation with the non-minimally coupled Standard Model Higgs in the\ncase when quantum corrections generate a hilltop in the potential. We consider\nboth the metric and the Palatini formulation of general relativity. We\ninvestigate hilltop inflation in different parts of the Higgs potential and\ncalculate predictions for CMB observables. We run the renormalization group\nequations up from the electroweak scale and down from the hilltop, adding a\njump in-between to account for unknown corrections in the intermediate regime.\nWithin our approximation, no viable hilltop inflation is possible for small\nfield values, where the non-minimal coupling has no role, nor for intermediate\nfield values. For large field values, hilltop inflation works. We find the\nspectral index to be $n_s\\leq0.96$ in both the metric and the Palatini\nformulation, the upper bound coinciding with the tree-level result. The\ntensor-to-scalar ratio is $r\\leq1.2\\times10^{-3}$ in the metric case and\n$r\\leq2.2\\times10^{-9}$ in the Palatini case. Successful inflation is possible\neven when the renormalization group running is continuous with no jumps. In the\nmetric formulation, $r$ is smaller than in Higgs inflation on the tree-level\nplateau or at the critical point, making it possible to distinguish hilltop\ninflation from these scenarios with next-generation CMB experiments.",

Using Monte Carlo\n(MC) based GEANT4 simulation, numerous parameters influencing the light\ncollection and thereby the energy resolution of the antineutrino detector\nmodule are studied: e.g., degrees of scintillator surface roughness, reflector\ntype, and its ap- plying method onto scintillator and light guide surface, the\nreflectivity of the reflector, light guide geometries and diameter of the\nphotocathode. The impact of each parameter is inves- tigated by looking at the\ndetected spectrum, i.e. the number photoelectrons per depositing energy. In\naddition, the average light collection efficiency of the detector module and\nits spatial variation are calculated for each simulation setup. According to\nthe simulation re- sults, it is found that photocathode size, light guide\nshape, reflectivity of reflecting material and wrapping method show a\nsignificant impact on the light collection efficiency while scin- tillator\nsurface polishing level and the choose of reflector type show relatively less\nimpact. This study demonstrates that these parameters are very important in the\ndesign of plastic scintillator included antineutrino detectors to improve the\nenergy resolution efficiency.",

    "summary": "This paper is the first report of n-type GaAs as a cryogenic scintillation\nradiation detector for the detection of electron recoils from interacting dark\nmatter (DM) particles in the poorly explored MeV/c2 mass range. Seven GaAs\nsamples from two commercial suppliers and with different silicon and boron\nconcentrations were studied for their low temperature optical and scintillation\nproperties. All samples are n-type even at low temperatures and exhibit\nemission between silicon donors and boron acceptors that peaks at 1.33 eV (930\nnm). The lowest excitation band peaks at 1.44 eV (860 nm) and the overlap\nbetween the emission and excitation bands is small. The X-ray excited\nluminosities range from 7 to 43 photons/keV. Thermally stimulated luminescence\nmeasurements show that n-type GaAs does not accumulate metastable radiative\nstates that could cause afterglow. Further development and use with cryogenic\nphotodetectors promises a remarkable combination of large target size,\nultra-low backgrounds, and a sensitivity to electron recoils of a few eV that\nwould be produced by DM particles as light as a few MeV/c2.",

    "summary": "The conventional approach to fixed-order perturbative QCD predictions is\nbased on an arbitrary choice of the renormalization scale, together with an\narbitrary range. This {\\it ad hoc} assignment of the renormalization scale\ncauses a mismatching of the QCD running coupling and its corresponding\ncoefficients at each order, leading to well-known renormalization\nscheme-and-scale ambiguities. However, these ambiguities are unnecessary,since\nas a basic requirement of renormalization group invariance (RGI), any physical\nobservable must be independent of the choice of both the renormalization scheme\nand the initial renormalization scale.The elimination of the scale and scheme\nambiguities relies heavily on how precisely we know the analytic form of the\nQCD running coupling.Conventional schemes for defining the QCD coupling suffer\nfrom a complex and scheme-dependent renormalization group equation (RGE), which\nis usually solved perturbatively at high orders due to the entanglement of the\nscheme-running and scale-running behaviors.In this paper, we show that these\ncomplications can be avoided by using the newly suggested $C$-scheme coupling,\nwhose scheme-and-scale running behaviors are governed by the same\nscheme-independent RGE....Given a measurement which sets the magnitude of the\ncoupling at a specific scale such as $M_Z$,the resulting pQCD predictions,\nafter applying the single-scale Principle of Maximum Conformality (PMC), become\nindependent of the choice of the renormalization scheme and the initial\nrenormalization scale, thus satisfying all conditions of the RGI....We\nillustrate these features for the non-singlet Adler function and $\\tau $ decay\nto $\\nu +$ hadrons at four-loop order. The PMC thus eliminates a serious\nsystematic scheme-and-scale error in pQCD predictions, greatly improving the\nprecision of tests of the Standard Model and the sensitivity of collider\nexperiments to new physics.",

Spectra from Pb-Pb collisions are\npresented in nine centrality intervals and are compared to a reference spectrum\nfrom pp collisions scaled by the number of binary nucleon-nucleon collisions.\nFor central collisions, the $p_{\\rm T}$ spectra are suppressed by more than a\nfactor of 7 around 6-7 GeV/$c$ with a significant reduction in suppression\ntowards higher momenta up to 30 GeV/$c$. The nuclear modification factor\n$R_{\\rm pPb}$, constructed from the pp and p-Pb spectra measured at the same\ncollision energy, is consistent with unity above 8 GeV/$c$. While the spectra\nin both pp and Pb-Pb collisions are substantially harder at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}\n= 5.02$ TeV compared to 2.76 TeV, the nuclear modification factors show no\nsignificant collision energy dependence. The obtained results should provide\nfurther constraints on the parton energy loss calculations to determine the\ntransport properties of the hot and dense QCD matter.",

In particular, the Higgs boson\ncouplings to third generation fermions is an important test of the mechanism of\nmass generation. In spite of their impact on the production and decay\nproperties of the Higgs boson, the values of these couplings are still\nuncertain and, in models of new physics, they can differ in magnitude as well\nas in sign with respect to the Standard Model case. In this article, we study\nthe possibility of a wrong sign bottom-quark Yukawa coupling within the\nframework of the Minimal and Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model.\nPossible experimental tests are also discussed, including novel decays of the\nheavy CP-even and CP-odd Higgs fields that may be probed in the near future and\nthat may lead to an explanation of some intriguing di-boson signatures observed\nat the ATLAS experiment.",

The classical electrodynamics for the X-boson model\nwas explored to understand its propagation in space-time. The field equations\n(Maxwell-type) and the corresponding wave equations were obtained. They\nindicate the dispersion relations of both a massive and massless particles.\nThese results can be interpreted as a photon and the X-boson (with a mass of 17\nMeV), respectively. The gauge symmetry and gauge transformations were\ndiscussed. A full model diagonalization was introduced to obtain a Maxwell\nsector added up to a Proca sector. After that, we have obtained the retarded\nGreen functions which yield the inhomogeneous solutions of the wave equations\nfor the X-boson fields. We have applied this solution to the charge point\nmotion, and we transformed the potential solution to a quadrature problem. In\nparticular, as an example, we have analyzed the point charge in a straight line\nuniform motion, where the corresponding electromagnetic charge were calculated.",

    "summary": "Deconfined QCD matter in heavy-ion collisions has been a topic of paramount\ninterest for many years. Quarkonia suppression in heavy-ion collisions at the\nRelativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and Large Hadron Collider (LHC)\nexperiments indicate the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) formation in such collisions.\nRecent experiments at LHC has given some indications of hot matter effect in\nasymmetric p$-$Pb nuclear collisions. Here, we employ a theoretical model to\ninvestigate the bottomonium suppression in Pb$-$Pb at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.76$,\n$5.02$ TeV, and in p$-$Pb at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$ TeV center-of-mass energies\nunder a QGP formation scenario. Our present formulation is based on a unified\nmodel consisting of suppression due to color screening, gluonic dissociation\nalong with the collisional damping. Regeneration due to correlated $Q\\bar Q$\npairs has also been taken into account in the current work. We obtain here the\nnet bottomonium suppression in terms of survival probability under the combined\neffect of suppression plus regeneration in the deconfined QGP medium. We mainly\nconcentrate here on the centrality, $N_\\text{part}$ and transverse momentum,\n$(p_{t})$ dependence of $\\Upsilon(1S)$ and $ \\Upsilon(2S)$ states suppression\nin Pb$-$Pb and p$-$Pb collisions at mid-rapidity. We compare our model\npredictions for $\\Upsilon(1S)$ and $\\Upsilon(2S)$ suppression to the\ncorresponding experimental data obtained at the LHC. We find that the\nexperimental observations on $p_t$ and $N_\\text{part}$ dependent suppression\nagree reasonably well with our model predictions.",

    "summary": "Multi-quark states were predicted by Gell-Mann at the birth time of the quark\nmodel. Recently numbers of exotic states which are believed to be multi-quark\nstates, have been experimentally confirmed (four-quark mesons and five-quark\nbaryons). Theoretical research indicates that the four-quark state might be of\nmolecular and/or tetraquark structures. We have all reasons to consider that\nthe meson containing four different flavors $su\\bar b\\bar d$ should exist and\ndecay via channel $X(5568)\\to B_s\\pi$. However, except the D0 collaboration,\nall other experimental collaborations reported negative observation on\n$X(5568)$ in this golden portal. This sharp contradiction stimulates interests\nof both theorists and experimentalists. To remedy this discrepancy we propose\nthat the supposed $X(5568)$ is a mixture of molecular state and tetraquark\nwhich destructively contribute to $X(5568)\\to B_s\\pi$. The cancellation may be\naccidental and should be incomplete. In this picture, there should be two\nphysical states with the same flavor ingredients whose spectra are $5344\\pm307$\nand $6318\\pm315$. $X(5568)$ lies in the error range of the first state. We\npredict the width of the second state (named as $S_2$) to be $\\Gamma(X_{S_2}\\to\nB_s\\pi)=224\\pm97$ MeV. We sincerely suggest searching for it in the future\nexperiments.",

    "summary": "We describe the concept and procedure of drifted-charge extraction developed\nin the MicroBooNE experiment, a single-phase liquid argon time projection\nchamber (LArTPC). This technique converts the raw digitized TPC waveform to the\nnumber of ionization electrons passing through a wire plane at a given time. A\nrobust recovery of the number of ionization electrons from both induction and\ncollection anode wire planes will augment the 3D reconstruction, and is\nparticularly important for tomographic reconstruction algorithms. A number of\nbuilding blocks of the overall procedure are described. The performance of the\nsignal processing is quantitatively evaluated by comparing extracted charge\nwith the true charge through a detailed TPC detector simulation taking into\naccount position-dependent induced current inside a single wire region and\nacross multiple wires. Some areas for further improvement of the performance of\nthe charge extraction procedure are also discussed.",

    "summary": "One of the most powerful cosmological datasets when it comes to constraining\nneutrino masses is represented by galaxy power spectrum measurements,\n$P_{gg}(k)$. The constraining power of $P_{gg}(k)$ is however severely limited\nby uncertainties in the modeling of the scale-dependent galaxy bias $b(k)$. In\nthis Letter we present a new method to constrain $b(k)$ by using the\ncross-correlation between the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) lensing signal\nand galaxy maps ($C_\\ell^{\\rm \\kappa g}$) using a simple but theoretically\nwell-motivated parametrization for $b(k)$. We apply the method using\n$C_\\ell^{\\rm \\kappa g}$ measured by cross-correlating Planck lensing maps and\nthe Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) Data Release 11 (DR11) CMASS\ngalaxy sample, and $P_{gg}(k)$ measured from the BOSS DR12 CMASS sample. We\ndetect a non-zero scale-dependence at moderate significance, which suggests\nthat a proper modeling of $b(k)$ is necessary in order to reduce the impact of\nnon-linearities and minimize the corresponding systematics. The accomplished\nincrease in constraining power of $P_{gg}(k)$ is demonstrated by determining a\n95% C.L. upper bound on the sum of the three active neutrino masses $M_{\\nu}$\nof $M_{\\nu}<0.19\\, {\\rm eV}$. This limit represents a significant improvement\nover previous bounds with comparable datasets. Our method will prove especially\npowerful and important as future large-scale structure surveys will overlap\nmore significantly with the CMB lensing kernel providing a large\ncross-correlation signal.",

    "summary": "We develop the framework to perform all-orders resummation of electroweak\nlogarithms of Q/M for inclusive scattering processes at energies Q much above\nthe electroweak scale M. We calculate all ingredients needed at next-to-leading\nlogarithmic (NLL) order and provide an explicit recipe to implement this for 2\n$\\to$ 2 processes. PDF evolution including electroweak corrections, which lead\nto Sudakov double logarithms, is computed. If only the invariant mass of the\nfinal-state is measured, all electroweak logarithms can be resummed by the PDF\nevolution, at least to LL. However, simply identifying a lepton in the final\nstate requires the corresponding fragmentation function and introduces angular\ndependence through the exchange of soft gauge bosons. We justify our approach\nwith a factorization analysis, finding that the objects entering the\nfactorization theorem do not need to be SU(2) $\\times$ U(1) gauge singlets,\neven though we perform the factorization and resummation in the symmetric\nphase. We also discuss a range of extensions, including jets and how to\ncalculate the EW logarithms when you are fully exclusive in the central\n(detector) region and fully inclusive in the forward (beam) regions.",

    "summary": "We explore the Renormalization Group flow of massive uncharged fermions -- a\ncandidate for dark matter -- coupled to a scalar field through a Higgs portal.\nWe find that fermionic fluctuations can lower the bound on the scalar mass that\narises from vacuum stability. Further, we discuss that despite the perturbative\nnonrenormalizability of the model, it could be ultraviolet complete at an\nasymptotically safe fixed point. In our approximation, this simple model\nexhibits two mechanisms for asymptotic safety: a balance of fermionic and\nbosonic fluctuations generates a fixed point in the scalar self-interaction;\nasymptotic safety in the portal coupling is triggered through a balance of\ncanonical scaling and quantum fluctuations. As a consequence of asymptotic\nsafety in the dark sector, the low-energy value of the portal coupling could\nbecome a function of the dark fermion mass and the scalar mass, thereby\nreducing the viable parameter space of the model.",

    "summary": "Motivated by the fact that the Dirac phase in the PMNS matrix is the only\nCP-violating parameter in the leptonic sector that can be measured in neutrino\noscillation experiments, we examine the possibility that it is the dominant\nsource of CP violation for leptogenesis caused by the out-of-equilibrium decays\nof heavy singlet fermions. We do so within a low-scale extended type-I seesaw\nmodel, featuring two Standard Model singlet fermions per family, in which\nlepton number is approximately conserved such that the heavy singlet neutrinos\nare pseudo-Dirac. We find that this produces a predictive model of\nleptogenesis. Our results show that for low-scale thermal leptogenesis, a pure\ninverse-seesaw scenario fails to produce the required asymmetry, even\naccounting for resonance effects, because wash-out processes are too efficient.\nDirac-phase leptogenesis is, however, possible when the linear seesaw term is\nswitched on, with the aid of the resonance contributions naturally present in\nthe model. Degenerate and hierarchical spectra are considered -- both can\nachieve Dirac-phase leptogenesis, although the latter is more constrained.\nFinally, although unable to probe the parameter space of Dirac-phase\nleptogenesis, the contributions to unitarity violation of the PMNS matrix,\ncollider constraints and charged-lepton flavour-violating processes are\ncalculated and we further estimate the impact of the future experiments MEG-II\nand COMET for such models.",

    "summary": "In the near future, fundamental interactions at high-energy scales may be\nmost efficiently studied via precision measurements at low energies. A\nuniversal language to assemble and interpret precision measurements is the\nso-called SMEFT, which is an effective field theory (EFT) where the Standard\nModel (SM) Lagrangian is extended by higher-dimensional operators. In this\npaper we investigate the possible impact of the DUNE neutrino experiment on\nconstraining the SMEFT. The unprecedented neutrino flux offers an opportunity\nto greatly improve the current limits via precision measurements of the trident\nproduction and neutrino scattering off electrons and nuclei in the DUNE near\ndetector. We quantify the DUNE sensitivity to dimension-6 operators in the\nSMEFT Lagrangian, and find that in some cases operators suppressed by an O(30)\nTeV scale can be probed. We also compare the DUNE reach to that of future\nexperiments involving atomic parity violation and polarization asymmetry in\nelectron scattering, which are sensitive to an overlapping set of SMEFT\nparameters.",

    "summary": "We demonstrate that the observation of neutron stars with masses greater than\none solar mass places severe demands on any exotic neutron decay mode that\ncould explain the discrepancy between beam and bottle measurements of the\nneutron lifetime. If the neutron can decay to a stable, feebly-interacting dark\nfermion, the maximum possible mass of a neutron star is 0.7 solar masses, while\nall well-measured neutron star masses exceed one solar mass. The survival of $2\nM_\\odot$ neutron stars therefore indicates that any explanation beyond the\nStandard Model for the neutron lifetime puzzle requires dark matter to be part\nof a multi-particle dark sector with highly constrained interactions.",

    "summary": "Understanding hydrodynamization in microscopic models of heavy-ion collisions\nhas been an important topic in current research. Many lessons obtained within\nthe strongly-coupled (holographic) models originate from the properties of\ntransient excitations of equilibrium encapsulated by short-lived quasinormal\nmodes of black holes. The aim of this paper is to develop similar intuition for\nexpanding plasma systems described by, perhaps, the simplest model from the\nweakly-coupled domain, i.e. the Boltzmann equation in the relaxation time\napproximation. We show that in this kinetic theory setup there are infinitely\nmany transient modes carrying at late times the vast majority of information\nabout the initial distribution function. They all have the same exponential\ndamping set by the relaxation time but are distinguished by different power-law\nsuppressions and different frequencies of very slow, logarithmic in proper\ntime, oscillations. Finally, we analyze the resurgent interplay between the\nhydrodynamics and transients. In particular, show that there are choices of\nrelaxation time dependence on temperature for which the asymptotics of the\ndivergent hydrodynamic series is dominated not be the least damped transient,\nbut rather by an unphysical exponential correction having to do with\nnon-analyticities of the equation of motion in complexified time variable.",

Since the masses of $^4{\\rm He}$ and $^4{\\rm Li}$ are almost equal,\nthe yield of $^4{\\rm Li}$ predicted by the thermal model is 5 times bigger than\nthat of $^4{\\rm He}$ which reflects the different numbers of internal degrees\nof freedom of the two nuclides.

Within the coalescence model the ratio of yields of\n$^4{\\rm Li}$ to $^4{\\rm He}$ is shown to be significantly smaller than that in\nthe thermal model and the ratio decreases fast from central to peripheral\ncollisions of relativistic heavy-ion collisions because the coalescence rate\nstrongly depends on the nucleon source radius.",

These are\ncombined with the soft hadronic activity measured by reconstructed\ncharged-particle tracks not associated with the hard objects. Possible double\ncounting of contributions from reconstructed charged-particle tracks from the\ninner detector, energy deposits in the calorimeter, and reconstructed muons\nfrom the muon spectrometer is avoided by applying a signal ambiguity resolution\nprocedure which rejects already used signals when combining the various\nE$_{T}^{miss}$ contributions. The individual terms as well as the overall\nreconstructed E$_{T}^{miss}$ are evaluated with various performance metrics for\nscale (linearity), resolution, and sensitivity to the data-taking conditions.\nThe method developed to determine the systematic uncertainties of the\nE$_{T}^{miss}$ scale and resolution is discussed.

    "summary": "The yields and production rates of the radioisotopes $^9$Li and $^8$He\ncreated by cosmic muon spallation on $^{12}$C have been measured by the Double\nChooz experiment. Comparing the data to a detailed simulation of the $^9$Li and\n$^8$He decays, the contribution of the $^8$He radioisotope is found to be\ncompatible with zero. The observed $^9$Li yields in the near ($\\sim$120 m.w.e\noverburden) and far ($\\sim$300 m.w.e.) detectors are $4.37\\pm0.49$ and\n$7.98\\pm0.52$ respectively, in units of $10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{\\mu ^{-1}g^{-1}cm^{2}\n}$. The low overburdens of the near and far detectors gives a unique insight\nwhen combined with measurements by KamLAND and Borexino to give the first\nmulti-experiment, data driven relationship between the $^9$Li yield and the\nmean muon energy according to the power law $Y =\nY_0\\left<E_\\mu\\right>^{\\overline{\\alpha}}$, giving\n$\\overline{\\alpha}=0.79\\pm0.06$ and $Y_0=(0.29\\pm0.09)\\times\n10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{\\mu ^{-1}g^{-1}cm^{2} }$.

    "summary": "Searches for neutrino-less double-beta decay ($0\\nu2\\beta$) place an\nimportant constraint on models where light fields beyond the Standard Model\nparticipate in the neutrino mass mechanism. While $0\\nu2\\beta$ experimental\ncollaborations often consider various massless majoron models, including\nvarious forms of majoron couplings and multi-majoron final-state processes,\nnone of these searches considered the scenario where the \"majoron\" $\\phi$ is\nnot massless, $m_\\phi\\sim$~MeV, of the same order as the $Q$-value of the\n$0\\nu2\\beta$ reaction. We consider this parameter region and estimate\n$0\\nu2\\beta\\phi$ constraints for $m_\\phi$ of order MeV. The constraints are\naffected not only by kinematical phase space suppression but also by a change\nin the signal to background ratio characterizing the search. As a result,\n$0\\nu2\\beta\\phi$ constraints for $m_\\phi>0$ diminish significantly below the\nreaction threshold. This has phenomenological implications, which we illustrate\nfocusing on high-energy neutrino telescopes. Our results motivate a dedicated\nanalysis by $0\\nu2\\beta$ collaborations, analogous to the dedicated analyses\ntargeting massless majoron models.",

In this work, we\npresent a novel approach to algorithmically establish the BFB conditions for\nany polynomial scalar potential. The method relies on elements of multivariate\nalgebra, in particular, on resultants and on the spectral theory of tensors,\nwhich is being developed by the mathematical community. We give first a\npedagogical introduction to this approach, illustrate it with elementary\nexamples, and then present the working Mathematica implementation publicly\navailable at GitHub. Due to the rapidly increasing complexity of the problem,\nwe have not yet produced ready-to-use analytical BFB conditions for new\nmulti-scalar cases.

    "summary": "QCD is not supersymmetrical in the traditional sense -- the QCD Lagrangian is\nbased on quark and gluonic fields, not squarks nor gluinos. However, its\nhadronic eigensolutions conform to a representation of superconformal algebra,\nreflecting the underlying conformal symmetry of chiral QCD and its Pauli matrix\nrepresentation. The eigensolutions of superconformal algebra provide a unified\nRegge spectroscopy of meson, baryon, and tetraquarks in the same 4-plet\nrepresentation with a universal Regge slope. The pion $q \\bar q$ eigenstate has\nzero mass for $m_q=0.$ The superconformal relations also can be extended to\nheavy-light quark mesons and baryons. The combined approach of light-front\nholography and superconformal algebra also provides insight into the origin of\nthe QCD mass scale and color confinement. A key observation is the remarkable\ndAFF principle which shows how a mass scale can appear in the Hamiltonian and\nthe equations of motion while retaining the conformal symmetry of the action.\nWhen one applies the dAFF procedure to chiral QCD, a mass scale $\\kappa$\nappears which determines universal Regge slopes, hadron masses in the absence\nof the Higgs coupling, and the mass parameter underlying the form of the\nnonperturbative QCD running coupling: $\\alpha_s(Q^2) \\propto \\exp{-{Q^2/4\n\\kappa^2}}$, in agreement with the effective charge determined from\nmeasurements of the Bjorken sum rule. The mass scale $\\kappa$ underlying hadron\nmasses can be connected to the parameter $\\Lambda_{\\overline {MS}}$ in the QCD\nrunning coupling by matching its predicted nonperturbative form to the\nperturbative QCD regime. One also obtains predictions for spacelike and\ntimelike hadronic form factors, structure functions, distribution amplitudes,\nand transverse momentum distributions.",

    "summary": "The ILL experiment, one of the \"reactor anomaly\" experiments, is re-examined.\nILL's baseline of 8.78 m is the shortest of the short baseline experiments, and\nit is the experiment that finds the largest fraction of the electron\nanti-neutrinos disappearing -- over 20%. Previous analyses, if they do not\nignore the ILL experiment, use functional forms for chisquare which are either\ntotally new and unjustified, are the magnitude chi-square (also termed a \"rate\nanalysis\"), or utilize a spectral form for chi-square which double counts the\nsystematic error. We do an analysis which utilizes the standard, conventional\nform for chi-square as well as a derived form for a spectral chi-square.\nResults for the ILL, Huber, and Daya Bay fluxes are given. We find that the\nimplications of the ILL experiment in providing evidence for a sterile, fourth\nneutrino are significantly enhanced. Moreover, we find that the ILL experiment\nprovides a set of choices for specific values of the mass squared difference.\nThe value of the mass square difference for the deepest minimum and its\nstatistical significance, using the flux independent spectral chi-square and\nthe Huber or Daya Bay flux are 0.92 eV$^2$ and 2.9 $\\sigma$; for the\nconventional chi-square and the Daya Bay flux are 0.95 eV$^2$ and 3.0 $\\sigma$;\nand for the conventional chi-square and Huber flux are 0.90 eV$^2$ and 3.3\n$\\sigma$. These probabilities are significantly larger than the 1.8 $\\sigma$\nfound for the ILL experiment using a rate analysis.",

Our calculation incorporates to all orders in perturbation\ntheory two distinct towers of logarithmic corrections which are enhanced,\nrespectively, at threshold, i.e. large x, and in the high-energy limit, i.e.\nsmall x. Large-x logarithms are resummed to next-to-next-to-next-to-leading\nlogarithmic accuracy, while small-x ones to leading logarithmic accuracy. The\ndouble-resummed cross section is furthermore matched to the state-of-the-art\nfixed-order prediction at next-to-next-to-next-to-leading accuracy.

    "summary": "Recently, a new minimal extension of the Standard Model has been proposed,\nwhere a spontaneously broken, flavor-dependent global U(1) symmetry is\nintroduced. It not only explains the hierarchical flavor structure in the quark\nand lepton sector, but also solves the strong CP problem by identifying the\nNambu-Goldstone boson as the QCD axion, which we call flaxion. In this work, we\nconsider supersymmetric extensions of the flaxion scenario. We study the CP and\nflavor violations due to supersymmetric particles, the effects of R-parity\nviolations, the cosmological gravitino and axino problems, and the cosmological\nevolution of the scalar partner of the flaxion, sflaxion. We also propose an\nattractor-like inflationary model where the flaxion multiplet contains the\ninflaton field, and show that a consistent cosmological scenario can be\nobtained, including inflation, leptogenesis, and dark matter.",

    "summary": "The relic abundance of heavy stable particles charged under a confining gauge\ngroup can be depleted by a second stage of annihilations near the deconfinement\ntemperature. This proceeds via the formation of quarkonia-like states, in which\nthe heavy pair subsequently annihilates. The size of the quarkonium formation\ncross section was the subject of some debate. We estimate this cross section in\na simple toy model. The dominant process can be viewed as a rearrangement of\nthe heavy and light quarks, leading to a geometric cross section of hadronic\nsize. In contrast, processes in which only the heavy constituents are involved\nlead to mass-suppressed cross sections. These results apply to any scenario\nwith bound states of sizes much larger than their inverse mass, such as U(1)\nmodels with charged particles of different masses, and can be used to construct\nultra-heavy dark-matter models with masses above the na\\\"ive unitarity bound.\nThey are also relevant for the cosmology of any stable colored relic.",

We investigate and detail the\nstructure of the CWI's and their non-perturbative solutions, and compare them\nto perturbation theory, taking QED as an example. In a first part we address in\nfull generality some methodological issues emerging when re-expressing the\nconformal generators in momentum space from position space, filling a gap in\nthe related literature. Such are the violation of the Leibniz rule and the\ntreatment of the derivative of the Dirac $\\delta$ terms related to conservation\nof the total momentum, induced by the Fourier transform. We present a complete\ndiscussion of this transition. We then proceed with an analysis of the $TJJ$\ncorrelator, presenting independent and detailed re-derivations of the conformal\nequations in the reconstruction method of BMS, originally formulated using a\nminimal tensor basis in the transverse traceless sector. Our results are then\nexemplified in massless QED at one-loop in $d$-dimensions expressed in terms of\nmaster integrals. The action of the conformal generators on the $TJJ$ in\n$d$-dimensions is directly worked out on the corresponding master integrals. We\nshow how the conformal constraints are explicitly imposed and solved in such\nperturbative realization of the conformal equations in their exact\n$d$-dimensional form and in their anomalous forms in $d=4$ after\nrenormalization.",

We calculate the\neffects induced by a modified potential up to one loop in single and double\nHiggs production and at the tree level in triple Higgs production, for both $Z$\nboson associated and $W$ boson fusion production mechanisms. We consider two\ndifferent scenarios. First, the dimension six operator provides the dominant\ncontribution (as expected, for instance, in a linear EFT); we find in this case\nthat the corresponding Wilson coefficient can be determined at\n$\\mathcal{O}(10\\%)$ accuracy by just combining accurate measurements of single\nHiggs cross sections at $\\sqrt{\\hat s}=$240-250 GeV and double Higgs production\nin $W$ boson fusion at higher energies. Second, both operators of dimension six\nand eight can give effects of similar order, i.e., independent quartic self\ncoupling deviations are present. Constraints on Wilson coefficients can be best\ntested by combining measurements from single, double and triple Higgs\nproduction. Given that the sensitivity of single Higgs production to the\ndimension eight operator is presently unknown, we consider double and triple\nHiggs production and show that combining their information colliders at higher\nenergies will provide first coarse constraints on the corresponding Wilson\ncoefficient.",

In particular, the string susceptibility index $\\gamma_{\\rm str}$ is 1\nin the usual perturbation theory, but equals 1/2 in the mean-field\napproximation that applies for 2<d<26. I show the total central charge equals\nzero for the mean field, which justifies the Alvarez-Arvis spectrum of the\neffective string, and argue that fluctuations about it do not spoil conformal\ninvariance.",

    "summary": "We propose a mechanism which generates primordial magnetic fields after the\n$e^+e^-$ annihilations. Our mechanism involves an ultra-light axion-like\nparticle (ALP) which constitutes the dark matter, and a dark $U(1)_X$ gauge\nboson introduced to bypass the obstacle placed by the conductivity of cosmic\nplasma. In our scheme, coherently oscillating ALP amplifies the dark photon\nfield, and part of the amplified dark photon field is concurrently converted to\nthe ordinary magnetic field through the ALP-induced magnetic mixing. For the\nrelevant ALP mass range $10^{-21} {\\rm eV}\\lesssim m_\\phi\\lesssim 10^{-17}{\\rm\neV}$, our mechanism can generate $B\\sim 10^{-24} \\,(m_\\phi/10^{-17} {\\rm\neV})^{5/4}\\,{\\rm G}$ with a coherent length $\\lambda \\sim (m_\\phi/10^{-17} {\\rm\neV})^{-1/2}$ kpc, which is large enough to provide a seed of the galactic\nmagnetic fields. The mechanism also predicts a dark $U(1)_X$ electromagnetic\nfield $E_X \\sim B_X\\sim 10\\,(m_\\phi/10^{-17}{\\rm eV})^{-1/4}{\\rm nG}$, which\ncan result in interesting astrophysical/cosmological phenomena by inducing the\nmixings between the ALP, ordinary photon, and dark photon states.",

The model introduces a preferred four vector $n$ which breaks\nLorentz symmetry and couples to a five-dimension operator. When the preferred\nfour vector is chosen in the pure timelike direction the model becomes a higher\ntime derivative theory leading to a cubic dispersion relation. Two of the poles\nare shown to be perturbative connected to the standard ones, while a third\npole, which we call Lee-Wick-like pole, can be associated to a negative metric,\nthreatening the preservation of unitarity. We analyze perturbative unitarity\nusing the optical theorem and considering a quartic self-interaction term. By\ncomputing discontinuities in the loop diagram, we arrive to a pinching\ncondition which also determines the propagation of the Lee-Wick-like particle\nthrough the cut.

    "summary": "If dark matter is composed of new particles, these may be gravitationally\nbound to the Sun after scattering on solar nuclei, thermalize after further\ninteractions, and finally annihilate into Standard Model particles, generating\nneutrinos which we can detect on Earth. Typically, one assumes that\nequilibration between capture and annihilations has been reached, so that the\nannihilation rate is completely determined by the capture rate. For elastic\ninteractions, this is usually an excellent approximation, while it may not be\nso for dark matter scattering inelastically into a slightly heavier\n($\\mathcal{O} (10-100)$ keV) state. One issue is that the kinetic energy of the\ncaptured dark matter, after having scattered a number of times, might not be\nsufficient to allow up-scattering, at which point the thermalization process\neffectively stops. Moreover, down-scatterings from the excited state may cause\na large evaporation rate. In this work we perform a numerical simulation of the\nwhole process in order to check: if the distribution reaches a stationary state\nin a solar lifetime; if thermalization with solar nuclei occurs, i.e., if the\nfinal distribution is isothermal (Maxwell-Boltzmann); in case the distribution\nis not isothermal, whether the annihilation rate into neutrinos is sizeable,\nand the conditions under which equilibrium between annihilation and capture is\nreached are satisfied; and finally, whether evaporation plays an important\nrole. We find that, unless the mass splitting is very small ($\\lesssim 50$ keV)\nand/or the dark matter has a sub-dominant elastic cross section, the dark\nmatter distribution does not reach a stationary state, it is not isothermal at\nthe solar temperature, annihilations are suppressed and equilibration is not\nreached. We also find that evaporation induced by down-scattering is not\neffective in reducing the total dark matter abundance.",

    "summary": "The forthcoming precision data on lepton flavour violating decays require\nprecise and efficient calculations in New Physics models. In this article\nlepton flavour violating processes within the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard\nModel (MSSM) are calculated using the method based on the Flavour Expansion\nTheorem, a recently developed technique performing a purely algebraic\nmass-insertion expansion of the amplitudes. The expansion in both\nflavour-violating and flavour-conserving off-diagonal terms of sfermion and\nsupersymmetric fermion mass matrices is considered. In this way the relevant\nprocesses are expressed directly in terms of the parameters of the MSSM\nLagrangian. We also study the decoupling properties of the amplitudes. The\nresults are compared to the corresponding calculations in the mass eigenbasis\n(i.e. using the exact diagonalization of the mass matrices). Using these\nmethods, we consider the following processes: $\\ell \\to \\ell' \\gamma$, $\\ell\n\\to 3 \\ell'$, $\\ell \\to 2\\ell'\\ell''$, $h \\to \\ell\\ell'$ as well as $\\mu \\to e$\nconversion in nuclei. In the numerical analysis we update the bounds on the\nflavour changing parameters of the MSSM and examine the sensitivity to the\nforthcoming experimental results. We find that flavour violating muon decays\nprovide the most stringent bounds on supersymmetric effects and will continue\nto do so in the future. Radiative $\\ell\\to\\ell^\\prime\\gamma$ decays and\nleptonic three-body decays $\\ell\\to 3\\ell^\\prime$ show an interesting\ncomplementarity in eliminating \"blind spots\" in the parameter space. In our\nanalysis we also include the effects of non-holomorphic $A$-terms which are\nimportant for the study of LFV Higgs decays.",

    "summary": "Quantum mechanical interactions between neutrinos and matter along the path\nof propagation, the Wolfenstein matter effect, are of particular importance for\nthe upcoming long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments, specifically the\nDeep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE). Here, we explore specifically what\nabout the matter density profile can be measured by DUNE, considering both the\nshape and normalization of the profile between the neutrinos' origin and\ndetection. Additionally, we explore the capability of a perturbative method for\ncalculating neutrino oscillation probabilities and whether this method is\nsuitable for DUNE. We also briefly quantitatively explore the ability of DUNE\nto measure the Earth's matter density, and the impact of performing this\nmeasurement on measuring standard neutrino oscillation parameters.",

    "summary": "Quantum simulators have the exciting prospect of giving access to real-time\ndynamics of lattice gauge theories, in particular in regimes that are difficult\nto compute on classical computers. Future progress towards scalable quantum\nsimulation of lattice gauge theories, however, hinges crucially on the\nefficient use of experimental resources. As we argue in this work, due to the\nfundamental non-uniqueness of discretizing the relativistic Dirac Hamiltonian,\nthe lattice representation of gauge theories allows for an optimization that up\nto now has been left unexplored. We exemplify our discussion with lattice\nquantum electrodynamics in two-dimensional space-time, where we show that the\nformulation through Wilson fermions provides several advantages over the\npreviously considered staggered fermions. Notably, it enables a strongly\nsimplified optical lattice setup and it reduces the number of degrees of\nfreedom required to simulate dynamical gauge fields. Exploiting the optimal\nrepresentation, we propose an experiment based on a mixture of ultracold atoms\ntrapped in a tilted optical lattice. Using numerical benchmark simulations, we\ndemonstrate that a state-of-the-art quantum simulator may access the Schwinger\nmechanism and map out its non-perturbative onset.",

    "summary": "Compact stellar objects offer deep insight into the physics of elementary\nparticles in dense environments through the imprint left by merger events on\nthe electromagnetic and gravitational wave spectra. The theoretical description\nof compact star interiors requires full knowledge of the equation of state\n(EoS) of nuclear matter and involves the non-perturbative solution of quantum\nchromodynamics (QCD), the theory of strongly interacting quarks and gluons.\nHowever, first-principle methods (most notably, lattice QCD simulations) are\nnot available for high neutron densities - consequently, the EoS of neutron\nstars necessarily relies on a modeling of the nuclear force. Here we propose a\ndifferent scenario, where the neutron density vanishes and a Bose-Einstein\ncondensate of charged pions (the lightest excitations in QCD) plays the central\nrole instead. This setting can be approached by first-principle methods and\nleads to a new class of compact stars: pion stars. As we demonstrate, pion star\nmatter exhibits gravitationally bound configurations and is metastable against\nelectroweak decays. If pion stars indeed exist in our Universe, this result\nconstitutes the first occasion that the EoS and the mass-radius relation of a\ncompact stellar object is determined from first principles within the Standard\nModel.",

The model also predicts the knees to\noccur at an energy of two to four million times the particle's rest mass.\nRecent data allow one to verify this prediction, particularly for Fe and\nlighter-nuclei CRs. But the most stringent test involves the putative knee in\nthe CR electron spectrum, since the mass ratio of electrons to protons (and\nnuclei) is so very different from their charge ratio(s). Very recent results on\nthe spectra of positrons and electrons at the highest measured energies\ncorroborate the existence of an electron knee, with the expected shape and at\nthe predicted energy.",

    "summary": "Primordial black holes (PBHs) can be produced by the perturbations which exit\nthe horizon during inflationary phase. While inflation models predict the power\nspectrum of the perturbations in Fourier space, the PBH abundance depends on\nthe probability distribution function (PDF) of density perturbations in real\nspace. In order to estimate the PBH abundance in a given inflation model, we\nmust relate the power spectrum in Fourier space to the PDF in real space by\ncoarse-graining the perturbations with a window function. However, there are\nuncertainties on what window function should be used, which could change the\nrelation between the PBH abundance and the power spectrum. This is particularly\nimportant in considering PBHs with mass $30 M_\\odot$ which account for the LIGO\nevents because the required power spectrum is severely constrained by the\nobservations. In this paper, we investigate how large influence the\nuncertainties on the choice of a window function have over the power spectrum\nrequired for LIGO PBHs. As a result, it is found that the uncertainties most\nsignificantly affect the prediction for the stochastic gravitational waves\n(GWs) induced by the second order effect of the perturbations. In particular,\nthe pulsar timing array constraints on the produced GWs could disappear for the\nreal-space top-hat window function.",

    "summary": "The Mu2e experiment at Fermilab searches for the charged-lepton flavour\nviolating (CLFV) conversion of a negative muon into an electron in the field of\nan aluminum nucleus, with a distinctive signature of a mono-energetic electron\nof energy slightly below the muon rest mass (104.967 MeV). The Mu2e goal is to\nimprove by four orders of magnitude the search sensitivity with respect to the\nprevious experiments. Any observation of a CLFV signal will be a clear\nindication of new physics. The Mu2e detector is composed of a tracker, an\nelectro- magnetic calorimeter and an external veto for cosmic rays surrounding\nthe solenoid. The calorimeter plays an important role in providing particle\nidentification capabilities, a fast online trigger filter, a seed for track\nreconstruction while working in vacuum, in the presence of 1 T axial magnetic\nfield and in an harsh radiation environment. The calorimeter requirements are\nto provide a large acceptance for 100 MeV electrons and reach at these\nenergies: (a) a time resolution better than 0.5 ns; (b) an energy resolution <\n10% and (c) a position resolution of 1 cm. The calorimeter design consists of\ntwo disks, each one made of 674 undoped CsI crystals read by two large area\narrays of UV-extended SiPMs. We report here the construction and test of the\nModule-0 prototype. The Module-0 has been exposed to an electron beam in the\nenergy range around 100 MeV at the Beam Test Facility in Frascati. Preliminary\nresults of timing and energy resolution at normal incidence are shown. A\ndiscussion of the technical aspects of the calorimeter engineering is also\nreported in this paper.",

    "summary": "In the paper we discussed the evolution equations for diffractive production\nin the framework of CGC/saturation approach, and found the analytical solutions\nfor several kinematic regions. The most impressive features of these solutions\nare, that diffractive production does not exibit geometric scaling behaviour\ni.e. being a function of one variable.\n  Based on these solutions, we suggest an impact parameter dependent saturation\nmodel, which is suitable for describing diffraction production both deep in the\nsaturation region, and in the vicinity of the saturation scale. Using the model\nwe attempted to fit the combined data on diffraction production from H1 and\nZEUS collaborations. We found that we are able describe both\n  $x_\\pom$ and $\\beta$ dependence, as well as $Q$ behavior of the measured\ncross sections. In spite of the sufficiently large $\\chi^2/d.o.f.$ we believe\nthat our description provides an initial impetus to find a fit of the\nexperimental data, based on the solution of the CGC/saturation equation, rather\nthan on describing the diffraction system in simplistic manner, assuming that\nonly quark-antiquark pair and one extra gluons, are produced.",

This implies, in particular, that in DVCS there is no direct access to\nthe (kinetic) orbital angular momentum of quarks through twist-3 GPDs.\nMoreover, using the quark-target model, we find that twist-3 GPDs can be\ndiscontinuous.

    "summary": "We are discussing the properties of the QCD vacuum which might be important\nespecially for the understanding of hadrons with small quark core size\n$\\sim0.3\\,fm.$ We assume that at these distances the QCD vacuum can be\ndescribed by the Instanton Liquid Model (ILM). At larger distances, where\nconfinement is important, ILM should be extended to Dyons Liquid Model (DLM).\nThe ILM has only two free parameters, average instanton size\n$\\rho\\approx0.3\\,fm$ and average inter-instanton distance $R\\approx1\\,fm$, and\ncan successfully describe the key features of light hadron physics. One of the\nimportant conceptual results was prediction of the momentum dependent dynamical\nquark mass $M\\sim(packing\\,\\,fraction)^{1/2}\\,\\,\\rho^{-1}\\approx360\\,MeV$,\nlater confirmed numerically by evaluations in the lattice. The estimates show\nthat gluon-instanton interaction strength is also big and is controlled by the\nvalue of dynamical gluon mass $M_{g}\\approx M$.

At small distances,\nwhere one-gluon exchange contribution to this potential is dominated, we have\nto take into account dynamical gluon mass $M_{g}$. Also, instantons are\ngenerating light-heavy quarks interactions and allow to describe the\nnonperturbative effects in heavy-light quarks systems.",

Several\nexperiments have recently measured the nuclear modification factor not only in\nminimum bias but also for central $pA$ collisions. In this paper we analyze the\nbias on the configurations of soft gluon fields introduced by a centrality\nselection via the number of hard particles. Such bias can be viewed as\nreweighting of configurations of small-$x$ gluons. We find that the biased\nnuclear modification factor ${\\cal Q}_{pA}(p_T)$ for central collisions is\nabove $R_{pA}(p_T)$ for minimum bias events, and that it may redevelop a\n\"Cronin peak\" even at small $x$. The magnitude of the peak is predicted to\nincrease approximately like $1/{A_{\\perp}}^\\nu$, $\\nu\\sim0.6\\pm0.1$, if one is\nable to select more compact configurations of the projectile proton where its\ngluons occupy a smaller transverse area $A_\\perp$.

    "summary": "A scale-invariant universe can have a period of accelerated expansion at\nearly times: inflation. We use a frame-invariant approach to calculate\ninflationary observables in a scale invariant theory of gravity involving two\nscalar fields - the spectral indices, the tensor to scalar ratio, the level of\nisocurvature modes and non-Gaussianity. We show that scale symmetry leads to an\nexact cancellation of isocurvature modes and that, in the scale-symmetry broken\nphase, this theory is well described by a single scalar field theory. We find\nthe predictions of this theory strongly compatible with current observations.",

    "summary": "LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) is a next generation dark matter direct detection experiment\nthat will operate 4850 feet underground at the Sanford Underground Research\nFacility (SURF) in Lead, South Dakota, USA. Using a two-phase xenon detector\nwith an active mass of 7 tonnes, LZ will search primarily for low-energy\ninteractions with Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), which are\nhypothesized to make up the dark matter in our galactic halo. In this paper,\nthe projected WIMP sensitivity of LZ is presented based on the latest\nbackground estimates and simulations of the detector. For a 1000 live day run\nusing a 5.6 tonne fiducial mass, LZ is projected to exclude at 90% confidence\nlevel spin-independent WIMP-nucleon cross sections above $1.6 \\times 10^{-48}$\ncm$^{2}$ for a 40 $\\mathrm{GeV}/c^{2}$ mass WIMP. Additionally, a $5\\sigma$\ndiscovery potential is projected reaching cross sections below the existing and\nprojected exclusion limits of similar experiments that are currently operating.\nFor spin-dependent WIMP-neutron(-proton) scattering, a sensitivity of $2.7\n\\times 10^{-43}$ cm$^{2}$ ($8.1 \\times 10^{-42}$ cm$^{2}$) for a 40\n$\\mathrm{GeV}/c^{2}$ mass WIMP is expected. With construction well underway, LZ\nis on track for underground installation at SURF in 2019 and will start\ncollecting data in 2020.",

An approach to\nidentify the renormalons is provided by exploiting an analytic solution of the\ngeneric one-loop renormalization group equations in multi-field theories.\nMethods to evaluate the regions in coupling space where the theory is\nresummable are described. The generalization is then illustrated in a toy model\nwith two coupled scalar fields, representing the simplest extension of the\none-field analysis presented in the seminal works of the subject. Furthermore,\npossible links to realistic theories are briefly discussed.",

As part of its HL-LHC upgrade program, the CMS collaboration\nis designing a High Granularity Calorimeter to replace the existing endcap\ncalorimeters. It features unprecedented transverse and longitudinal\nsegmentation for both electromagnetic (ECAL) and hadronic (HCAL) compartments.\nThis will facilitate particle-flow calorimetry, where the fine structure of\nshowers can be measured and used to enhance pileup rejection and particle\nidentification, whilst still achieving good energy resolution. The ECAL and a\nlarge fraction of HCAL will be based on hexagonal silicon sensors of 0.5 to 1\ncm$^2$ cell size, with the remainder of the HCAL based on highly-segmented\nscintillators with SiPM readout. The intrinsic high-precision timing\ncapabilities of the silicon sensors will add an extra dimension to event\nreconstruction, especially in terms of pileup rejection. An overview of the\nHGCAL project is presented, covering motivation, engineering design, readout\nand trigger concepts, and expected performance.",

We show that in\nthis model, the DM annihilation rate becomes more prominent for larger\nmultiplets and it is already within the reach of currently operating Imaging\nAtmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs), High Energy Stereoscopic System\n(H.E.S.S.). Furthermore, Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), which will begin\noperating in 2030, will improve this sensitivity by a factor of\n$\\mathcal{O}{(10)}$ and may exclude a large portion of parameter space of this\nradiative neutrino mass model with larger electroweak multiplet.

For a positive cosmological\nconstant or effective scalar potential, one-loop perturbation theory around\nflat space is divergent due to an instability of the graviton propagator.\nFunctional renormalization solves this problem by a flow of couplings avoiding\ninstabilities. This leads to a graviton barrier limiting the maximal growth of\nthe effective potential for large values of scalar fields. In the presence of\nthis barrier, variable gravity can solve the cosmological constant problem by a\ncosmological runaway solution. We discuss the naturalness of tiny values of the\ncosmological constant and cosmon mass due to a strong attraction towards an\ninfrared fixed point.",

    "summary": "We have investigated the effects of strong magnetic field on the properties\nof quarkonia immersed in a thermal medium of quarks and gluons and studied its\nquasi-free dissociation due to the Landau-damping. Thermalizing the Schwinger\npropagator in the lowest Landau levels for quarks and the Feynman propagator\nfor gluons in real-time formalism, we have calculated the resummed retarded and\nsymmetric propagators, which in turn give the real and imaginary components of\ndielectric permittivity, respectively. The magnetic field affects the\nlarge-distance interaction more than the short-distance interaction, as a\nresult, the real part of potential becomes more attractive and the magnitude of\nimaginary part too becomes larger, compared to the thermal medium in absence of\nstrong magnetic field. As a consequence the average size of $J/\\psi$'s and\n$\\psi^\\prime$'s are increased but $\\chi_c$'s get shrunk. Similarly the magnetic\nfield affects the binding of $J/\\psi$'s and $\\chi_c$'s discriminately, i.e. it\ndecreases the binding of $J/\\psi$ and increases for $\\chi_c$. However, the\nfurther increase in magnetic field results in the decrease of binding energies.\nOn contrary the magnetic field increases the width of the resonances, unless\nthe temperature is sufficiently high. We have finally studied how the presence\nof magnetic field affects the dissolution of quarkonia in a thermal medium due\nto the Landau damping, where the dissociation temperatures are found to\nincrease compared to the thermal medium in absence of magnetic field. However,\nfurther increase of magnetic field decreases the dissociation temperatures. For\nexample, $J/\\psi$'s and $\\chi_c$'s are dissociated at higher temperatures at 2\n$T_c$ and 1.1 $T_c$ at a magnetic field $eB \\approx 6~{\\rm{and}}~4~m_\\pi^2$,\nrespectively, compared to the values 1.60 $T_c$ and 0.8 $T_c$ in the absence of\nmagnetic field, respectively.",

    "summary": "A measurement of the production cross section for a top quark pair in\nassociation with a $Z$ boson ($t\\bar{t}Z$) is presented in this PhD thesis.\nFinal states with exactly three charged leptons (electrons or muons) are used,\ntaking into account the decay of the top quark pair in the lepton+jets channel\nand the decay of the $Z$ boson into two charged leptons. The dataset used for\nthis analysis corresponds to 36.1 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collisions at a\ncentre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, recorded during 2015 and 2016 by the ATLAS\ndetector at the Large Hadron Collider. The result of a profile likelihood fit\nto the event yields in four signal enriched regions and two background enriched\nregions is\n$\\sigma_{t\\bar{t}Z}=966^{+114}_{-102}(\\text{stat.})^{+115}_{-114}(\\text{syst.})$\nfb. The observed (expected) significance is $7.2$ ($6.4$) standard deviations\nfrom the background-only hypothesis. Within the experimental uncertainties, the\nresult is in good agreement with the Standard Model prediction. This result is\ncompared with two other $t\\bar{t}Z$ analysis channels, using the same dataset\nbut different lepton multiplicities. The analysis presented here is found to be\nthe most sensitive one in terms of observed significance. The result of a\ncombined fit of all three analysis channels is discussed. Two feasibility\nstudies of possible future $t\\bar{t}Z$ analysis techniques are demonstrated.",

Antoniou {\\it\net al.}, Phys. Rev. D 97, 034015 (2018)) that combined measurements of the\nintermittency index $\\phi_2$ and the freeze-out parameters $\\mu_b$\n(baryochemical potential), $T$ (temperature), provide us with a powerful tool\nto detect the critical point. We also show that the finite-size scaling (FSS)\nregion, as a part of the critical region, is very narrow in both the chemical\npotential and the temperature direction, even for light nuclei. Furthermore,\nusing published experimental results for $(\\mu_b,T,\\phi_2)$ in A+A collisions\nat $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=17.2$ GeV (NA49 experiment, CERN-SPS), we are able to make a\nset of predictions for the freeze-out states of Ar + Sc and Xe + La collisions\nat the same energy in the NA61/SHINE experiment (CERN-SPS). In particular, we\nfind that the Ar + Sc system freezes out outside the FSS region but very close\nto its boundary, a property which may leave characteristic traces in\nintermittency analysis.",

    "summary": "Various binary black hole formation channels have been proposed since the\nfirst gravitational event GW150914 was discovered by the Advanced Laser\nInterferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (AdLIGO). For all evolutionary\nchannels based on the evolution of isolated binaries, the immediate progenitor\nof the binary black hole is a close binary system composed of a black hole and\na helium star. We perform detailed binary evolution and systematically explore\nthe parameter space of initial binary properties, including initial black hole\nand helium star masses, initial rotation of the helium star as well as\nmetallicity. We argue that the spin of the first-born black hole at its birth\nis negligible ($\\lesssim 0.1$), hence the second-born black hole's spin\ndominates the measured effective spin, $\\chi_{\\rm eff}$, from gravitational\nwave events of double black hole mergers. We find that tides can be important\nonly when orbital periods are shorter than 2 days. Upon core collapse, the\nhelium star produces a black hole (the second-born black hole in the system)\nwith a spin that can span the entire range from zero to maximally spinning. We\nshow that the bimodal distribution of the spin of the second-born black hole\nobtained in recent papers is mainly due to oversimplifying assumptions. We find\nan anti-correlation between the merging timescale of the two black holes,\nT$_{\\rm merger}$, and the effective spin $\\chi_{\\rm eff}$. Finally, we provide\nnew prescriptions for the tidal coefficient E$_2$ for both H-rich and the\nhelium-rich stars. We predict that, with future improvements to AdLIGO's\nsensitivity, the sample of merging binary black hole systems will show an\noverdensity of sources with positive but small $\\chi_{\\rm eff}$. originating\nfrom lower mass black hole mergers born at low redshift.",

There is a nice agreement with latest global\nanalyses supporting $\\sin\\delta < 0$ and normal ordering at $ \\sim 95\\%$ C.L.\nOn the other hand, the more stringent experimental lower bound on the\natmospheric mixing angle starts to corner strong thermal $SO(10)$-inspired\nleptogenesis. Prompted and encouraged by this rapid experimental advance, we\nobtain a precise determination of the allowed region in the plane $\\delta$\nversus $\\theta_{23}$. We confirm that for the benchmark case $\\alpha_2 \\equiv\nm_{D2} / m_{\\rm charm}= 5 \\, $, where $m_{D2}$ is the intermediate neutrino\nDirac mass setting the mass of $N_2$, and initial pre-existing $B-L$ asymmetry\n$N_{B-L}^{\\rm p, i} = 10^{-3}$, the bulk of the solutions lies in the first\noctant. Though most of the solutions are found outside the $95\\%$ C.L.\nexperimental region, there is still a big allowed fraction that does not\nrequire a too fine-tuned choice of the Majorana phases so that the neutrinoless\ndouble beta decay effective neutrino mass allowed range is still $m_{ee}\\simeq\n[10,30]\\,{\\rm meV}$.

In particular, the current best fit,\n($\\theta_{23},\\delta)\\simeq (47^{\\circ}, -130^{\\circ})$, can be reproduced for\n$\\alpha_2 =6$, a value obtained recently in a few realistic fits.

    "summary": "We conduct large scale numerical simulations of gravitational wave production\nat a first order vacuum phase transition. We find a power law for the\ngravitational wave power spectrum at high wavenumber which falls off as\n$k^{-1.5}$ rather than the $k^{-1}$ produced by the envelope approximation. The\npeak of the power spectrum is shifted to slightly lower wave numbers from that\nof the envelope approximation. The envelope approximation reproduces our\nresults for the peak power less well, agreeing only to within an order of\nmagnitude. After the bubbles finish colliding the scalar field oscillates\naround the true vacuum. An additional feature is produced in the UV of the\ngravitational wave power spectrum, and this continues to grow linearly until\nthe end of our simulation. The additional feature peaks at a length scale close\nto the bubble wall thickness and is shown to have a negligible contribution to\nthe energy in gravitational waves, providing the scalar field mass is much\nsmaller than the Planck mass.",

    "summary": "In recent years the Tsallis statistics is gaining popularity in describing\ncharged particle produc- tion and their properties, in particular pT spectra\nand the multiplicities in high energy particle collisions. Motivated by its\nsuccess, an analysis of the LHC data of proton-proton collisions at ener- gies\nranging from 0.9 TeV to 7 TeV in different rapidity windows for charged\nparticle multiplicities has been done. A comparative analysis is performed in\nterms of the Tsallis distribution, the Gamma distribution and the shifted-Gamma\ndistribution. An interesting observation on the inapplicability of these\ndistributions at sqrt{s}=7 TeV in the lower rapidity windows is intriguing. The\nnon-extensive nature of the Tsallis statistics is studied by determining the\nentropic index and its energy depen- dence. The analysis is extrapolated to\npredict the multiplicity distribution at sqrt{s}=14 TeV for one rapidity\nwindow, |y| < 1.5 with the Tsallis function.",

    "summary": "We present the first determination of $\\rho \\pi$ scattering using lattice\nQCD, a first-principles numerical approach to QCD. Considering the case of\nisospin-2 $\\rho \\pi$, we calculate partial-wave amplitudes with $J \\le 3$ and\ndetermine the degree of dynamical mixing between the coupled $S$ and $D$-wave\nchannels with $J^P=1^+$. The analysis makes use of the relationship between\nscattering amplitudes and the discrete spectrum of states in the finite volume\nlattice. Constraints on the scattering amplitudes are provided by over one\nhundred energy levels computed on two lattice volumes at various overall\nmomenta and in several irreducible representations of the relevant symmetry\ngroups. The spectra follow from variational analyses of matrices of\ncorrelations functions computed with large bases of meson-meson operators.\nCalculations are performed with degenerate light and strange quarks tuned to\nthe physical strange quark mass so that $m_\\pi \\sim 700$ MeV, ensuring that the\n$\\rho$ is stable against strong decay. This work demonstrates the successful\napplication of various techniques and opens the door to calculations of\nscattering processes that feature hadrons with non-zero intrinsic spin,\nincluding those involving resonances or bound states.",

    "summary": "Chameleon and symmetron theories serve as archetypal models for how light\nscalar fields can couple to matter with gravitational strength or greater, yet\nevade the stringent constraints from classical tests of gravity on Earth and in\nthe Solar System. In this work, we investigate how a precision measurement of\nthe electron magnetic moment places meaningful constraints on both chameleons\nand symmetrons. Two effects are identified: First, virtual chameleons and\nsymmetrons run in loops to generate quantum corrections to the intrinsic value\nof the magnetic moment; a common process widely considered in the literature\nfor many beyond-the-Standard-Model scenarios. A second effect, however, is\nunique to scalar fields that exhibit screening. A scalar bubble-like profile\nforms inside the experimental vacuum chamber and exerts a fifth force on the\nelectron, leading to a systematic shift in the experimental measurement. In\nquantifying this latter effect, we present a novel approach that combines\nanalytic arguments and a small number of numerical simulations to solve for the\nbubble-like profile quickly for a large range of model parameters. Taken\ntogether, both effects yield interesting constraints in complementary regions\nof parameter space. While the constraints we obtain for the chameleon are\nlargely uncompetitive with those in the existing literature, this still\nrepresents the tightest constraint achievable yet from an experiment not\noriginally designed to search for fifth forces. We break more ground with the\nsymmetron, for which our results exclude a large and previously unexplored\nregion of parameter space. Central to this achievement are the quantum\ncorrection terms, which are able to constrain symmetrons with masses in the\nrange $\\mu \\in [10^{-3.88},10^8]\\,\\text{eV}$, whereas other experiments have\nhitherto only been sensitive to one or two orders of magnitude at a time.\n[Abridged]",

    "summary": "Charge symmetry breaking (CSB) effects associated with the $u$ and $d$ quark\nmass difference are investigated in the quark distribution functions and\nspacelike electromagnetic form factors of the pion and kaon. We use a confining\nversion of the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model, where CSB effects at the infrared\nscale associated with the model are driven by the dressed $u$ and $d$ quark\nmass ratio, which because of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking is much closer\nto unity than the associated current quark mass ratio. The pion and kaon are\ngiven as bound states of a dressed quark and a dressed antiquark governed by\nthe Bethe-Salpeter equation, and exhibit the properties of Goldstone bosons,\nwith a pion mass difference given by $m_{\\pi^+}^2 - m_{\\pi^0}^2 \\propto (m_u -\nm_d)^2$ as demanded by dynamical chiral symmetry breaking. We find significant\nCSB effects for realistic current quark mass ratios ($m_u/m_d \\sim 0.5$) in the\nquark flavor-sector electromagnetic form factors of both the pion and kaon. For\nexample, the difference between the $u$ and $d$ quark contributions to the\n$\\pi^+$ electromagnetic form factors is about 8\\% at a momentum transfer of\n$Q^2 \\simeq 10\\,$GeV$^2$, while the analogous effect for the light quark sector\nform factors in the $K^+$ and $K^0$ is about twice as large.

The branching\nfractions of ${\\mathcal B}(D^0\\to \\pi^-\\mu^+\\nu_\\mu)$ and ${\\mathcal B}(D^+\\to\n\\pi^0\\mu^+\\nu_\\mu)$ are measured to be $(0.267 \\pm 0.007_{\\rm stat.} \\pm\n0.007_{\\rm syst.})\\%$ and $(0.342 \\pm 0.011_{\\rm stat.} \\pm 0.010_{\\rm\nsyst.})\\%$, respectively, where the former is of much improved precision\ncompared to previous results and the latter is determined for the first time.\nUsing these results along with previous BESIII measurements, we calculate\n${\\mathcal B}(D^{0}\\to \\pi^{-}\\mu^+\\nu_\\mu)/{\\mathcal B}(D^{0}\\to\n\\pi^{-}e^+\\nu_e)$ and ${\\mathcal B}(D^{+}\\to \\pi^{0}\\mu^+\\nu_\\mu)/{\\mathcal\nB}(D^{+}\\to \\pi^{0}e^+\\nu_e)$ to be $0.905\\pm 0.027_{\\rm stat.}\\pm0.023_{\\rm\nsyst.}$ and $0.942\\pm 0.037_{\\rm stat.}\\pm0.027_{\\rm syst.}$, which are\ncompatible with the theoretical prediction of lepton universality within\n$1.9\\sigma$ and $0.6\\sigma$, respectively.

This serves to quantify how important a given\nnew reported decay channel is, from the point of view of the information that\nit adds to the already known ones. Because the entropy is additive, one can\nsubdivide the set of channels and discuss, for example, how much information\nthe discovery of a new decay branching would add; or subdivide the decay\ndistribution down to the level of individual quantum states (which can be\nquickly counted by the phase space).

    "summary": "The tau-lepton plays an important role in the physics program at the Large\nHadron Collider (LHC). It offers a probe in searches for New Physics and to\nmeasure parameters of the Standard Model. Spin of tau lepton is an interesting\nphenomenological quantity for separation of signal from background or in\nmeasuring properties of particles. A proper treatment of tau spin effects in\nthe Monte Carlo simulations is important for understanding the detector\nacceptance as well as for the measurements/use of tau polarization and tau spin\ncorrelations. The TauSpinner is a tool to modify tau$spin effects in any\nsample. Also production matrix elements can be modified with its help. The\ngeneral principle of TauSpinner algorithm rely on the kinematic of outgoing\nparticles (or jets) only, and to average over all possible initial states\naccordingly to assumed parton distributions and cross-sections. Incoming on\nmass-shell parton four-momenta are reconstructed in approximation, but\nenergy-momentum conservation is obeyed. Samples of events featuring tau leptons\nwith their decay products, can be used as an input. The information on the\npolarization and spin correlations, and production/decay matrix elements is\nreconstructed from the kinematics of the tau lepton(s) (also nu_tau in case of\nW-mediated processes) and tau decay products (also jets). No other information\nis required. By calculating spin (or production/decay matrix element) weights,\nattributed to each event, it enables evaluation of modifications without\nregenerating events.\n  Elements of program functionalities together with explanation of the use are\ngiven in Appendices. Present publication collect program documentation,\npreviously scattered over several publiications.",

    "summary": "We propose a strategy of extracting the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix\nelement $|V_{cb}|$ from two-body hadronic decay processes of $B\\to DK$ with\nprecisely determined form factors of $B$ meson semi-leptonic decays. The\namplitude $\\mathcal{M}(\\bar{B}^0 \\to D^+ K^-)$ without the effect of hadronic\nfinal state interactions can be theoretically evaluated by using factorization\nand form factors of semi-leptonic B-decays. We can obtain all the amplitudes in\nan isospin relation $\\mathcal{A}(B^-\\to D^0K^-) =\\mathcal{A}(\\bar{B}^0\\to\nD^+K^{-})+\\mathcal{A}(\\bar{B}^0\\to D^{0}\\bar{K}^0)$, including the effect of\nhadronic final state interactions as well as $|V_{cb}|$ using the experimental\ndata of branching fractions of these three processes. The extracted value of\n$|V_{cb}|$ is $(37\\pm 6)\\times 10^{-3}$. The decay processes of $B\\to DK^{*}$\nand $B\\to D^{*}K$ can also be used in the same way and the extracted values of\n$|V_{cb}|$ are $(41\\pm 7)\\times 10^{-3}$ and $(42\\pm 9)\\times 10^{-3}$,\nrespectively. This method becomes possible by virtue of recent precise\ndeterminations of the form factors of semi-leptonic B-decays. The errors in\nextracted $|V_{cb}|$ are expected to be improved by the results of future\nB-factory experiments and lattice calculations.",

In much the same way a singly heavy baryon is\nregarded as $N_c-1$ valence quarks bound by the same mean fields, which makes\nit possible to use the properties of light baryons to investigate those of the\nheavy baryons. A heavy quark being regarded as a static color source in the\nlimit of the infinitely heavy quark mass, the magnetic moments of the heavy\nbaryon are determined entirely by the chiral soliton consisting of a\nlight-quark pair. The magnetic moments of the baryon sextet are obtained by\nusing the parameters fixed in the light-baryon sector. In this mean-field\napproach, the numerical results of the magnetic moments of the baryon sextet\nwith spin $3/2$ are just 3/2 larger than those with spin $1/2$. The magnetic\nmoments of the bottom baryons are the same as those of the corresponding\ncharmed baryons.",

    "summary": "Neutron stars (NSs) obtain kicks of typically several 100 km/s at birth. The\ngravitational tug-boat mechanism can explain these kicks as consequences of\nasymmetric mass ejection during the supernova (SN) explosion. Support for this\nhydrodynamic explanation is provided by observations of SN remnants with\nassociated NSs, which confirm the prediction that the bulk of the explosion\nejecta, in particular chemical elements between silicon and the iron group, are\ndominantly expelled in the hemisphere opposite to the direction of the NS kick.\nHere, we present a large set of two- and three-dimensional explosion\nsimulations of electron-capture SNe, considering explosion energies between\n~3x10^49 erg and ~1.6x10^50 erg. We find that the fast acceleration of the SN\nshock in the steep density gradient delimiting the O-Ne-Mg core of the\nprogenitor enables such a rapid expansion of neutrino-heated matter that the\ngrowth of neutrino-driven convection freezes out quickly in a high-mode\nspherical harmonics pattern. Since the corresponding momentum asymmetry of the\nejecta is very small and the gravitational acceleration by the fast-expanding\nejecta abates rapidly, the NS kick velocities are at most a few km/s. The\nextremely low core compactness of O-Ne-Mg-core progenitors therefore favors\nhydrodynamic NS kicks much below the ~160 km/s measured for the Crab pulsar.\nThis suggests either that the Crab Nebula is not the remnant of an\nelectron-capture SN, but of a low-mass iron-core progenitor, or that the Crab\npulsar was not accelerated by the gravitational tug-boat mechanism but received\nits kick by a non-hydrodynamic mechanism such as, e.g., anisotropic neutrino\nemission.",

    "summary": "[Abridged] Indirect detection of dark matter (DM) by multi-wavelength\nastronomical observations provides a promising avenue for probing the particle\nnature of DM. In the case of DM consisting of Weakly-Interacting Massive\nParticles (WIMPs), self-annihilation ultimately produces observable products\nincluding $e^{\\pm}$ pairs and gamma rays. The gamma rays can be detected\ndirectly, while the $e^{\\pm}$ pairs can be detected by radio emission from\nsynchrotron radiation or X-rays and soft gamma rays from inverse Compton\nscattering. An intriguing region to search for astrophysical signs of DM is the\nGalactic center (GC) of the Milky Way, due in part to an observed excess of\ngamma-rays that could be DM. A recent observation by the Fermi-LAT\ncollaboration of a similar excess in the central region of the Andromeda galaxy\n(M31) leads us to explore the possibility of a DM-induced signal there as well.\nWe use the RX-DMFIT tool to perform a multi-frequency analysis of potential DM\nannihilation emissions in M31. We consider WIMP models consistent with the GC\nexcess and calculate the expected emission across the electromagnetic spectrum\nin comparison with available observational data from M31. We find that the\nparticle models that best fit the M31 excess favor lower masses than the GC\nexcess. The best fitting models are for a $b\\bar{b}$ final state with\n$M_{\\chi}=11$ GeV and $\\left<\\sigma v\\right>=2.26\\times 10^{-26}$\ncm$^3$s$^{-1}$, as well as an evenly mixed $b\\bar{b}/\\tau^+\\tau^-$ final state\nwith $M_{\\chi}=5.8$ GeV and $\\left<\\sigma v\\right>=2.03\\times 10^{-26}$\ncm$^3$s$^{-1}$. For conservative estimates of the diffusion and magnetic field\nmodels the expected radio emissions appear to be in tension with currently\navailable data in the central region of M31, although this constraint has a\nfairly strong dependence on the values chosen for parameters describing the\nmagnetic field strength and geometry.",

The spontaneous breaking of\n$U(1)_{B-L}$ leaves a residual $Z_2$ symmetry that stabilizes the DM and\ngenerates tiny neutrino mass at the two-loop level with the color seesaw\nmechanism. We investigate the imprint of this model on two of cosmic-ray\nanomalies: the Fermi-LAT gamma-ray excess at the Galactic Center (GCE) and the\nPeV ultra-high energy (UHE) neutrino events at the IceCube. We found that the\nFermi-LAT GCE spectrum can be well fitted by DM annihilation into a pair of\non-shell singlet Higgs mediators while being compatible with the constraints\nfrom relic density, direct detections as well as dwarf spheroidal galaxies in\nthe Milky Way. Although the UHE neutrino events at the IceCube could be\naccounted for by resonance production of a TeV-scale leptoquark, the relevant\nYukawa couplings have been severely constrained by current low energy flavor\nphysics.

    "summary": "Aniyan et al. (2018) have recently published direct measurements of the\nbaryonic mass distribution and the rotation curve of the almost-face-on disc\ngalaxy NGC 628. While its very low inclination makes this galaxy anything but\nideal for rotation-curve analysis, these new results, taken at face value, have\ninteresting ramifications for MOND. The methods employed afford a direct\ndetermination of the stellar mass in the disc, which, in turn, affords a\nparameter-free MOND prediction of the rotation curve, which I show. In\ncomparison, the dark-matter fits that Aniyan et al. present have two free\nparameters. To boot, these results further negate an earlier claim deleterious\nto MOND. It is that stellar $M/L$ ratios deduced from vertical velocity\ndispersions in disc galaxies are rather lower than what is required by MOND\nfits to rotation curves. Specifically, it was claimed that even\nhigh-surface-density discs are, by and large, sub maximal; viz., that they show\nsubstantial mass discrepancies near their center. This is contrary to the\nprediction of MOND that in such high-acceleration regions only small\ndiscrepancies should appear, if any to speak of. Such claims of low $M/L$\nvalues have been rebutted before, and the fallacy that may have led to them\npointed out. The new results strongly buttress these rebuttals.",

    "summary": "We determine constraints on spatially-flat tilted dynamical dark energy XCDM\nand $\\phi$CDM inflation models by analyzing Planck 2015 cosmic microwave\nbackground (CMB) anisotropy data and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) distance\nmeasurements. XCDM is a simple and widely used but physically inconsistent\nparameterization of dynamical dark energy, while the $\\phi$CDM model is a\nphysically consistent one in which a scalar field $\\phi$ with an inverse\npower-law potential energy density powers the currently accelerating\ncosmological expansion. Both these models have one additional parameter\ncompared to standard $\\Lambda$CDM and both better fit the TT + lowP + lensing +\nBAO data than does the standard tilted flat-$\\Lambda$CDM model, with $\\Delta\n\\chi^2 = -1.26\\ (-1.60)$ for the XCDM ($\\phi$CDM) model relative to the\n$\\Lambda$CDM model. While this is a 1.1$\\sigma$ (1.3$\\sigma$) improvement over\nstandard $\\Lambda$CDM and so not significant, dynamical dark energy models\ncannot be ruled out. In addition, both dynamical dark energy models reduce the\ntension between the Planck 2015 CMB anisotropy and the weak lensing $\\sigma_8$\nconstraints.",

    "summary": "The cross section of associated production of a Z boson with heavy flavor\njets in $pp$ collisions is calculated using the SHERPA Monte Carlo generator\nand the analytical combined QCD approach based on kt-factorization at small x\nand conventional collinear QCD at large x. A satisfactory description of the\nATLAS and CMS data on the $p_T$ spectra of Z bosons and c-jets in the whole\nrapidity, y, region is shown. Searching for the intrinsic charm (IC)\ncontribution in these processes, which could be visible at large y > 1.5, we\nstudy observables very sensitive to non-zero IC contributions and less affected\nby theoretical QCD scale uncertainties. One of such observables is the\nso-called double ratio: the ratio of the differential cross section of Z + c\nproduction in the central region of |y| < 1.5 and in the forward region 1.5 <\n|y| < 2.5, divided by the same ratio for Z + b production. These observables\ncould be more promising for the search of IC at LHC as compared to the\nobservables considered earlier.",

    "summary": "This paper reports measurements of final-state proton multiplicity, muon and\nproton kinematics, and their correlations in charged-current pionless neutrino\ninteractions, measured by the T2K ND280 near detector in its plastic\nscintillator (C$_8$H$_8$) target. The data were taken between years 2010 and\n2013, corresponding to approximately 6$\\times10^{20}$ protons on target. Thanks\nto their exploration of the proton kinematics and of kinematic imbalances\nbetween the proton and muon kinematics, the results offer a novel probe of the\nnuclear-medium effects most pertinent to the (sub-)GeV neutrino-nucleus\ninteractions that are used in accelerator-based long-baseline neutrino\noscillation measurements. These results are compared to many neutrino-nucleus\ninteraction models which all fail to describe at least part of the observed\nphase space. In case of events without a proton above a detection threshold in\nthe final state, a fully consistent implementation of the local Fermi gas model\nwith multinucleon interactions gives the best description of the data. In the\ncase of at least one proton in the final state the spectral function model\nagrees well with the data, most notably when measuring the kinematic imbalance\nbetween the muon and the proton in the plane transverse to the incoming\nneutrino. A clear indication of existence of multinucleon interactions is\nobserved. The effect of final-state interactions is also discussed.",

    "summary": "Reliable analysis of the Electroweak phase transition (EWPT) requires use of\nnon-perturbative methods. We apply the method of finite-temperature dimensional\nreduction to the Two-Higgs-Doublet Model (2HDM). This allows us to study the\nEWPT in this model, in terms of a non-perturbative study of three-dimensional\neffective theories. We present a detailed derivation of the mapping between the\nfull four-dimensional and the effective three-dimensional theories. In\nparticular, we study the case where the second scalar doublet is so heavy in\nthe vicinity of the phase transition that it can be integrated out. The\nresulting effective three-dimensional theory is the same as in the case of the\nStandard Model, and existing non-perturbative results can be recycled. In the\nalignment limit of the 2HDM, results of our study are presented in the\ncompanion paper.",

    "summary": "For all the success of the Standard Model (SM), it is on the verge of being\nsurpassed. In this regard we argue, by showing a minimal flavor-structured\nmodel, that $U(1)$ mixed-gravitational anomaly cancellation could be of central\nimportance in constraining the fermion contents of a new chiral gauge theory\nrealized in gauge/gravity duality. Such anomaly-free condition together with\nthe SM flavor structure demands a condition $k_1\\,X_1/2=k_2\\,X_2$ with $X_i$\nbeing a charge of $U(1)_{X_i}$ and $k_i$ being some integers, both of which are\nflavor dependent. We show that axionic domain-wall condition $N_{\\rm DW}$ with\nthe anomaly free-condition depends on both $U(1)_X$ charged quark and lepton\nflavors; the seesaw scale congruent to the scale of Peccei-Quinn symmetry\nbreakdown can be constrained through constraints coming from astrophysics and\nparticle physics. Then the model can be well flavor-structured in a unique way\nthat $N_{\\rm DW}=1$ with the $U(1)_X$ mixed-gravitational anomaly-free\ncondition demands additional Majorana fermion and the flavor puzzles of SM are\nwell delineated by new expansion parameters expressed in terms of $U(1)_X$\ncharges and $U(1)_X$-$[SU(3)_C]^2$ anomaly coefficients, providing remarkable\nresults on neutrino (hierarchical mass spectra and unmeasurable\nneutrinoless-double-beta decay rate together with the predictions on\natmospheric mixing angle and leptonic Dirac CP phase favored by the recent\nlong-baseline neutrino experiments), QCD axion, and flavored-axion.",

    "summary": "In-situ production of long-lived isotopes by cosmic muon interactions may\ngenerate a non-negligible background for deep underground rare event searches.\nPrevious Monte Carlo studies for the GERDA experiment at LNGS identified the\ndelayed decays of $^{77}$Ge and its metastable state $^{77m}$Ge as dominant\ncosmogenic background in the search for neutrinoless double beta decay of\n$^{76}$Ge. This might limit the sensitivity of next generation experiments\naiming for increased $^{76}$Ge mass at background-free conditions and thereby\ndefine a minimum depth requirement. A re-evaluation of the $^{77(m)}$Ge\nbackground for the GERDA experiment has been carried out by a set of Monte\nCarlo simulations. The obtained $^{77(m)}$Ge production rate is (0.21$\\pm$0.01)\nnuclei/(kg$\\cdot$yr). After application of state-of-the-art active background\nsuppression techniques and simple delayed coincidence cuts this corresponds to\na background contribution of (2.7$\\pm$0.3)$\\cdot10^{-6}$\ncts/(keV$\\cdot$kg$\\cdot$yr). The suppression achieved by this strategy equals\nan effective muon flux reduction of more than one order of magnitude. This\nvirtual depth increase opens the way for next generation rare event searches.",

The virial coefficients are related to the phase\nshifts which are calculated using K-matrix formalism in the present work. We\nhave calculated various thermodynamics quantities like pressure, energy\ndensity, and entropy density of the system. A comparison of thermodynamic\nquantities with non interacting HRG model, calculated using the same number of\nhadrons, shows that the results of above formalism are larger. A good agreement\nbetween equation of state calculated in K-matrix formalism and lattice QCD\nsimulations is observed. Specifically the lattice QCD calculated interaction\nmeasure is well described in our formalism.

    "summary": "The particle production in relativistic heavy-ion collisions seems to be\ncreated in a dynamically disordered system which can be best described by an\nextended exponential entropy. In distinguishing between the applicability of\nthis and Boltzmann-Gibbs (BG) in generating various particle-ratios, generic\n(non)extensive statistics (GNS) is introduced to the hadron resonance gas\nmodel. Accordingly, the degree of (non)extensivity is determined by the\npossible modifications in the phase space. Both BG extensivity and Tsallis\nnonextensivity are included as very special cases defined by specific values of\nthe equivalence classes $(c, d)$. We found that the particle ratios at energies\nranging between $3.8$ and $2760~$GeV are best reproduced by nonextensive\nstatistics, where $c$ and $d$ range between $\\sim0.9$ and $\\sim1$. The present\nwork aims at illustrating that the proposed approach is well capable to\nmanifest the statistical nature of the system on interest. We don't aim at\nhighlighting deeper physical insights. In other words, while the resulting\nnonextensivity is neither BG nor Tsallis, the freezeout parameters are found\nvery compatible with BG and accordingly with the well-known freezeout\nphase-diagram, which is in an excellent agreement with recent lattice\ncalculations. We conclude that the particle production is nonextensive but\nshould not necessarily be accompanied by a radical change in the intensive or\nextensive thermodynamic quantities, such as internal energy and temperature.\nOnly, the two critical exponents defining the equivalence classes $(c, d)$ are\nthe physical parameters characterizing the (non)extensivity.",

In this paper, we point out that the redshift distribution of the\nobserved merger events can provide complementary information for studying the\nblack hole mass distribution, because the detectability correlates the event\nredshift to the black hole masses. Based on the five observed events and using\nthe Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, we have found that the maximum of the stellar\nblack hole masses are constrained to be below $76\\,M_\\odot$ at 90\\% confidence\nlevel, for a negative power-law index of 2.3 for the heavier black hole.

    "summary": "Introducing version 2 of the code vh@nnlo, we study the effects of a number\nof new-physics scenarios on the Higgs-Strahlung process. In particular, the\ncross section is evaluated within a general 2HDM and the MSSM. While the\nDrell-Yan-like contributions are consistently taken into account by a simple\nrescaling of the SM result, the gluon-initiated contribution is supplemented by\nsquark-loop mediated amplitudes, and by the $s$-channel exchange of additional\nscalars which may lead to conspicuous interference effects. The latter holds as\nwell for bottom-quark initiated Higgs Strahlung, which is also included in the\nnew version of vh@nnlo. Using an orthogonal rotation of the three Higgs CP\neigenstates in the 2HDM and the MSSM, vh@nnlo incorporates a simple means of CP\nmixing in these models. Moreover, the effect of vector-like quarks in the SM on\nthe gluon-initiated contribution can be studied. Beyond concrete models,\nvh@nnlo allows to include the effect of higher-dimensional operators on the\nproduction of CP-even Higgs bosons. Transverse momentum distributions of the\nfinal state Higgs boson and invariant mass distributions of the $V\\phi$ final\nstate for the gluon- and bottom-quark initiated contributions can be studied.\nDistributions for the Drell-Yan-like component of Higgs-Strahlung can be\nincluded through a link to MCFM. vh@nnlo can also be linked to FeynHiggs and\n2HDMC for the calculation of Higgs masses and mixing angles. It can also read\nthese parameters from an SLHA-file as produced by standard spectrum generators.\nThroughout the manuscript, we highlight new-physics effects in various\nnumerical examples, both at the inclusive level and for distributions.",

    "summary": "We discuss lepton number violation in three units. From an effective field\ntheory point of view, $\\Delta L=3$ processes can only arise from dimension 9 or\nhigher operators. These operators also violate baryon number, hence many of\nthem will induce proton decay. Given the high dimensionality of these\noperators, in order to have a proton half-life in the observable range, the new\nphysics associated to $\\Delta L=3$ processes should be at a scale as low as 1\nTeV. This opens up the possibility of searching for such processes not only in\nproton decay experiments but also at the LHC. In this work we analyze the\nrelevant $d=9,11,13$ operators which violate lepton number in three units. We\nthen construct one simple concrete model with interesting low- and high-energy\nphenomenology.",

    "summary": "Observations of gravitational waves from neutron star mergers open up novel\ndirections for exploring fundamental physics: they offer the first access to\nthe structure of objects with a non-negligible contribution from vacuum energy\nto their total mass. The presence of such vacuum energy in the inner cores of\nneutron stars occurs in new QCD phases at large densities, with the vacuum\nenergy appearing in the equation of state for a new phase. This in turn leads\nto a change in the internal structure of neutron stars and influences their\ntidal deformabilities which are measurable in the chirp signals of merging\nneutron stars. By considering three commonly used neutron star models we show\nthat for large chirp masses the effect of vacuum energy on the tidal\ndeformabilities can be sizable. Measurements of this sort have the potential to\nprovide a first test of the gravitational properties of vacuum energy\nindependent from the acceleration of the Universe, and to determine the size of\nQCD contributions to the vacuum energy.",

    "summary": "The latest observations of extensive air showers (EAS) induced by\nultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECR) appear to indicate a transition to heavy\nprimaries at the highest energies. However, this interpretation, which is based\non extrapolations of the Standard Model (SM) to ultra-LHC energies, is strained\nfrom both astrophysical and particle phenomenology perspectives. The\nalternative is that some new physical effect affects EAS above some energy\nthreshold. Here, we quantify the phenomenological constraints encoded in the\nlatest Auger cosmic-ray data for any such new phenomenon. We consider the\npossibility that after some energy threshold, the first collision of the\nprimary in the atmosphere results in a state, the decay of which leads to a\nconsiderably increased shower particle multiplicity early in the development of\nthe shower, so that light-primary EAS appear heavy-like. We show that a\nminimal, generic implementation of such a model yields predictions for the\naverage EAS depth and shower-to-shower fluctuations that are consistent with\neach other, and an excellent fit to Auger data. If this is indeed the effect\nunderlying the phenomenology revealed by Auger at the highest energies, we\npredict that: (a) the center-of-momentum (CM) energy threshold for the effect\nlies between 14 and 60 TeV, with most likely value at 45 TeV; (b) the\nprobability with which the effect occurs is high, and it will be detected\neasily by next-generation accelerators; (c) the increase in multiplicity\n(compared to the SM prediction for a collision of similar CM energy) grows with\nCM energy as $E_{\\rm CM}^{1.14 \\pm 0.07}$; (d) the cosmic-ray composition at\nthe highest energies is light. Remarkably, if the latter is confirmed\nelectromagnetically (e.g. through studies of primary propagation in the Milky\nWay magnetic field) then this would necessitate the existence of new physics by\nthese energies.",

    "summary": "Extensive air shower (EAS) arrays directly sample the shower particles that\nreach the observation altitude. They are wide field of view (FoV) detectors\nable to view the whole sky simultaneously and continuously. In fact, EAS arrays\nhave an effective FoV of about 2 sr and operate with a duty cycle of\n$\\sim$100\\%. This capability makes them well suited to study extended sources,\nsuch as the Galactic diffuse emission and measure the spectra of Galactic\nsources at the highest energies (near or beyond 100 TeV). Their sensitivity in\nthe sub-TeV/TeV energy domain cannot compete with that of Cherenkov telescopes,\nbut the wide FoV is ideal to perform unbiased sky surveys, discover transients\nor explosive events (GRBs) and monitor variable or flaring sources such as\nActive Galactic Nuclei (AGN). An EAS array is able to detect at the same time\nevents induced by photons and charged cosmic rays, thus studying the connection\nbetween these two messengers of the non-thermal Universe. Therefore, these\ndetectors are, by definition, multi-messenger instruments.\n  Wide FoV telescopes are crucial for a multi-messenger study of the\nGravitational Wave events due to their capability to survey simultaneously all\nthe large sky regions identified by LIGO and VIRGO, looking for a possible\ncorrelated $\\gamma$-ray emission.\n  In this contribution we summarize the scientific motivations which push the\nconstruction of new wide FoV air shower detectors and introduce the future\ninstruments currently under installation. Finally, we emphasize the need of an\nEAS array in the Southern hemisphere to monitor the Inner Galaxy and face a\nnumber of important open problems.",

    "summary": "Above a critical dark matter-nucleus scattering cross section any terrestrial\ndirect detection experiment loses sensitivity to dark matter, since the Earth\ncrust, atmosphere, and potential shielding layers start to block off the dark\nmatter particles. This critical cross section is commonly determined by\ndescribing the average energy loss of the dark matter particles analytically.\nHowever, this treatment overestimates the stopping power of the Earth crust.\nTherefore the obtained bounds should be considered as conservative. We perform\nMonte Carlo simulations to determine the precise value of the critical cross\nsection for various direct detection experiments and compare them to other dark\nmatter constraints in the low mass regime. In this region we find parameter\nspace where typical underground and surface detectors are completely blind to\ndark matter. This \"hole\" in the parameter space can hardly be closed with an\nincrease in the detector exposure. Dedicated surface or high-altitude\nexperiments may be the only way to directly probe this part of the parameter\nspace.",

    "summary": "Seesaw mechanism constrains from below mixing between active and sterile\nneutrinos for fixed sterile neutrino masses. Signal events associated with\nsterile neutrino decays inside a detector at fixed target experiment are\nsuppressed by the mixing angle to the power of four. Therefore sensitivity of\nexperiments such as SHiP and DUNE should take into account minimal possible\nvalues of the mixing angles. We extend the previous study of this subject\narXiv:1312.2887 [hep-ph] to a more general case of non-zero CP-violating phases\nin the neutrino sector. Namely, we provide numerical estimate of minimal value\nof mixing angles between active neutrinos and two sterile neutrinos with the\nthird sterile neutrino playing no noticeable role in the mixing. Thus we obtain\na sensitivity needed to fully explore the seesaw type I mechanism for sterile\nneutrinos with masses below 2 GeV, that is relevant for the fixed-target\nexperiments. Remarkably, we observe a strong dependence of this result on the\nlightest active neutrino mass and the neutrino mass hierarchy, not only on the\nvalues of CP-violating phases themselves. All these effects sum up to push the\nlimit of experimental confirmation of sterile-active neutrino mixing by several\norders of magnitude below the results of arXiv:1312.2887 [hep-ph] from\n$10^{-10}$ - $10^{-11}$ down to $10^{-12}$ and even to $10^{-20}$ in parts of\nparameter space; nonzero CP-violating phases are responsible for that.",

    "summary": "We investigate the impacts of the gravitational-wave (GW) standard siren\nobservation of the Einstein Telescope (ET) on constraining the total neutrino\nmass. We simulate 1000 GW events observed by the ET in the future 10 years by\ntaking the standard $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology as a fiducial model. We combine the\nsimulated GW data with other cosmological observations including cosmic\nmicrowave background (CMB), baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), and type Ia\nsupernovae (SN). We consider three mass hierarchy cases for the neutrino mass,\ni.e., normal hierarchy (NH), inverted hierarchy (IH), and degenerate hierarchy\n(DH). Using Planck+BAO+SN, we obtain $\\sum m_\\nu<0.175$ eV for the NH case,\n$\\sum m_\\nu<0.200$ eV for the IH case, and $\\sum m_\\nu<0.136$ eV for the DH\ncase. After considering the GW data, i.e., using Planck+BAO+SN+GW, the\nconstraint results become $\\sum m_\\nu<0.151$ eV for the NH case, $\\sum\nm_\\nu<0.185$ eV for the IH case, and $\\sum m_\\nu<0.122$ eV for the DH case. We\nfind that the GW data can help reduce the upper limits of $\\sum m_\\nu$ by\n13.7%, 7.5%, and 10.3% for the NH, IH, and DH cases, respectively. Besides, we\nfind that the GW data can also help break the degeneracies between $\\sum\nm_{\\nu}$ and other parameters. We show that the GW data of the ET could greatly\nimprove the constraint accuracies of cosmological parameters.",

    "summary": "In the context of Standard Model (SM) extensions, the seesaw mechanism\nprovides the most natural explanation for the smallness of neutrino masses. In\nthis work we consider the most economical type-I seesaw realization in which\ntwo right-handed neutrinos are added to the SM field content. For the sake of\npredictability, we impose the maximum number of texture zeros in the lepton\nYukawa and mass matrices. All possible patterns are analyzed in the light of\nthe most recent neutrino oscillation data, and predictions for leptonic CP\nviolation are presented. We conclude that, in the charged-lepton mass basis,\neight different texture combinations are compatible with neutrino data at\n$1\\sigma$, all of them for an inverted-hierarchical neutrino mass spectrum.\nFour of these cases predict a CP-violating Dirac phase close to $3\\pi/2$, which\nis around the current best-fit value from global analysis of neutrino\noscillation data. If one further reduces the number of free parameters by\nconsidering three equal elements in the Dirac neutrino Yukawa coupling matrix,\nseveral texture combinations are still compatible with data but only at\n$3\\sigma$. For all viable textures, the baryon asymmetry of the Universe is\ncomputed in the context of thermal leptogenesis, assuming (mildly) hierarchical\nheavy Majorana neutrino masses $M_{1,2}$. It is shown that the flavored regime\nis ruled out, while the unflavored one requires $M_{1} \\sim 10^{14}$ GeV.",

    "summary": "Understanding of particle physics will be incomplete without knowing the true\nnature i.e. Dirac or Majorana, and absolute effective mass of neutrinos. This\nwill lead us into the world of beyond the standard model physics.

Observation of\n0$\\nu\\beta\\beta$ implies not only neutrinos are Majorana particles but also the\nlepton number violation. There are already intense activities going on over the\nworld-wide for the experimental searches of 0$\\nu\\beta\\beta$. In these\nexperiments, some are currently in their running phase and several experiments\nhave been projected. With the same motivation as the other experiments, the\nTIN-TIN (The INdia$^{'}$s TIN detector) experiment has been projected by the\nscientific community of India. This experiment, in coming future, will be\nhoused in the approved underground laboratory of INO (India based Neutrino\nObservatory), to search 0$\\nu\\beta\\beta$ using enriched $^{124}$Sn isotope as\nthe target mass.

    "summary": "Studies of fluctuations and correlations of soft hadrons and hard and\nelectromagnetic probes of the dense and strongly interacting medium require\nevent-by-event hydrodynamic simulations of high-energy heavy-ion collisions\nthat are computing intensive. We develop a (3+1)D viscous hydrodynamic model --\nCLVisc that is parallelized on Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) using Open\nComputing Language (OpenCL) with 60 times performance increase for space-time\nevolution and more than 120 times for the Cooper-Frye particlization relative\nto that without GPU parallelization. The pseudo-rapidity dependence of\nanisotropic flow $v_n(\\eta)$ are then computed in CLVisc with initial\nconditions given by the A Multi-Phase Transport (AMPT) model, with energy\ndensity fluctuations both in the transverse plane and along the longitudinal\ndirection. Although the magnitude of $v_n(\\eta)$ and the ratios between\n$v_2(\\eta)$ and $v_3(\\eta)$ are sensitive to the effective shear viscosity over\nentropy density ratio $\\eta_v/s$, the shape of the $v_{n}(\\eta)$ distributions\nin $\\eta$ do not depend on the value of $\\eta_v/s$. The decorrelation of $v_n$\nalong the pseudo-rapidity direction due to the twist and fluctuation of the\nevent-planes in the initial parton density distributions is also studied. The\ndecorrelation observable $r_n(\\eta^a, \\eta^b)$ between $v_n\\{-\\eta^a\\}$ and\n$v_n\\{\\eta^a\\}$ with the auxiliary reference window $\\eta^b$ is found not\nsensitive to $\\eta_v/s$ when there is no initial fluid velocity. For small\n$\\eta_v/s$, the initial fluid velocity from mini-jet partons introduces sizable\nsplitting of $r_n(\\eta^a, \\eta^b)$ between the two reference rapidity windows\n$\\eta^b \\in [3, 4]$ and $\\eta^b \\in [4.4, 5.0]$, as has been observed in\nexperiment.

    "summary": "Hyperon-nucleon interactions serve as basic inputs to studies of hypernuclear\nphysics and dense (neutron) stars. Unfortunately, a precise understanding of\nthese important quantities have lagged far behind that of the nucleon-nucleon\ninteraction due to lack of high precision experimental data. Historically,\nhyperon-nucleon interactions are either formulated in quark models or meson\nexchange models. In recent years, lattice QCD simulations and chiral effective\nfield theory approaches start to offer new insights from first principles. In\nthe present work, we contrast the state of art lattice QCD simulations with the\nlatest chiral hyperon-nucleon forces and show that the leading order\nrelativistic chiral results can already describe the lattice QCD data\nreasonably well. Given the fact that the lattice QCD simulations are performed\nwith pion masses ranging from the (almost) physical point to 700 MeV, such\nstudies provide a highly non-trivial check on both the chiral effective field\ntheory approaches as well as lattice QCD simulations. Nevertheless more precise\nlattice QCD simulations are eagerly needed to refine our understanding of\nhyperon-nucleon interactions.",

    "summary": "We provide a systematic renormalization group formalism to study the mass\neffects in the relation of the pole mass and short-distance masses such as the\n$\\overline{\\mathrm{MS}}$ mass of a heavy quark $Q$, coming from virtual loop\ninsertions of massive quarks lighter than $Q$ with the main focus on the top\nquark. The formalism reflects the constraints from heavy quark symmetry and\nentails a combined matching and evolution procedure that allows to disentangle\nand successively integrate out the corrections coming from the lighter massive\nquarks and the momentum regions between them and also to precisely control the\nlarge order asymptotic behavior. The formalism is used to study the asymptotic\nbehavior of light massive flavor contributions and is applied to predict the\n${\\cal O}(\\alpha_s^4)$ virtual quark mass corrections, calculate the pole mass\ndifferences for massive quark flavors with a precision of around 20 MeV, and\ndetermine the pole mass ambiguity which amounts to 250 MeV in the physical case\nof three massless quark flavors.",

    "summary": "We study the critical values ($\\alpha_{c}, a_{c}$) of the quintessential and\nspin parameters, to distinguish a rotating Kiselev black hole (RKBH) from a\nnaked singularity. For any value of the dimensionless quintessential parameter\n$\\omega_{q} \\in (-1, -1/3)$, a black hole can exist if $\\alpha$ $\\leq$\n$\\alpha_{c}$ and $a$ $\\leq$ $a_{c}$. Both $\\alpha_{c}$ and $a_{c}$ are directly\nproportional to $\\omega_{q}$. Further, for any $\\omega_{q}$, when increasing\nthe value of $\\alpha$ from zero to $\\alpha_{c}$, the size of the event horizon\nincreases, whereas the size of the outer horizon decreases. We also study the\ncritical value of the quintessential parameter $\\overline{\\alpha}_c$ for the\nKiselev black hole (KBH) and find horizons of extremal black holes. It is seen\nthat, similar to a RKBH, for a KBH with any $\\omega_{q}$, when increasing the\nvalue of $\\alpha$, the size of the event horizon increases, while the size of\nthe outer horizon decreases. We then study the spin precession of a test\ngyroscope attached to a stationary observer in this spacetime. Using the spin\nprecessions we differentiate black holes from naked singularities. If the\nprecession frequency becomes arbitrarily large, as approaching to the central\nobject in the quintessential field along any direction, then the spacetime is a\nblack hole. A spacetime will contain a naked singularity if the precession\nfrequency remains finite everywhere except at the singularity itself. Finally,\nwe study the Lense-Thirring precession frequency for RKBHs and the geodetic\nprecession for KBHs.",

In\ngeneral, the interaction of dark matter with the target nuclei may well proceed\nvia different mechanisms, which would lead to a different shape of the\ncorresponding nuclear structure factors as a function of the momentum transfer\n$q$. We study to what extent different WIMP-nucleus responses can be\ndifferentiated based on the $q$-dependence of their structure factors (or \"form\nfactors\"). We assume an overall strength of the interaction consistent with\npresent spin-independent limits and consider an exposure corresponding to\nXENON1T-like, XENONnT-like, and DARWIN-like direct detection experiments. We\nfind that, as long as the interaction strength does not lie too much below\ncurrent limits, the DARWIN settings allow a conclusive discrimination of many\ndifferent response functions based on their $q$-dependence, with immediate\nconsequences for elucidating the nature of dark matter.",

    "summary": "We calculate the up-, down-, strange-, charm-, and bottom-quark masses using\nthe MILC highly improved staggered-quark ensembles with four flavors of\ndynamical quarks. We use ensembles at six lattice spacings ranging from\n$a\\approx0.15~$fm to $0.03~$fm and with both physical and unphysical values of\nthe two light and the strange sea-quark masses. We use a new method based on\nheavy-quark effective theory (HQET) to extract quark masses from heavy-light\npseudoscalar meson masses. Combining our analysis with our separate\ndetermination of ratios of light-quark masses we present masses of the up,\ndown, strange, charm, and bottom quarks. Our results for the\n$\\overline{\\text{MS}}$-renormalized masses are $m_u(2~\\text{GeV}) =\n2.118(38)~$MeV, $m_d(2~\\text{GeV}) = 4.690(54)~$MeV, $m_s(2~\\text{GeV}) =\n92.52(69)~$MeV, $m_c(3~\\text{GeV}) = 984.3(5.6)~$MeV, and $m_c(m_c) =\n1273(10)~$MeV, with four active flavors; and $m_b(m_b) = 4197(14)~$MeV with\nfive active flavors. We also obtain ratios of quark masses $m_c/m_s =\n11.784(22)$, $m_b/m_s = 53.93(12)$, and $m_b/m_c = 4.577(8)$. The result for\n$m_c$ matches the precision of the most precise calculation to date, and the\nother masses and all quoted ratios are the most precise to date. Moreover,\nthese results are the first with a perturbative accuracy of $\\alpha_s^4$. As\nbyproducts of our method, we obtain the matrix elements of HQET operators with\ndimension 4 and 5: $\\overline{\\Lambda}_\\text{MRS}=552(30)~$MeV in the minimal\nrenormalon-subtracted (MRS) scheme, $\\mu_\\pi^2 = 0.06(22)~\\text{GeV}^2$, and\n$\\mu_G^2(m_b)=0.38(2)~\\text{GeV}^2$. The MRS scheme [Phys. Rev. D97, 034503\n(2018), arXiv:1712.04983 [hep-ph]] is the key new aspect of our method.",

    "summary": "In this work we study temporal quantum correlations, quantified by\nLeggett-Garg (LG) and LG-type inequalities, in the $B$ and $K$ meson systems.\nWe use the tools of open quantum systems to incorporate the effect of\ndecoherence which is quantified by a single phenomenological parameter. The\neffect of $CP$ violation is also included in our analysis. We find that the LG\ninequality is violated for both $B$ and $K$ meson systems, the violation being\nmost prominent in the case of $K$ mesons and least for $B_s$ system. Since the\nsystems with no coherence do not violate LGI, incorporating\n\\textit{decoherence} is expected to decrease the extent of violation of LGI and\nis clearly brought out in our results. We show that the expression for the LG\nfunctions depends upon an additional term, apart from the experimentally\nmeasurable meson transition probabilities. This term vanishes in the limit of\nzero decoherence. On the other hand, the LG-type parameter can be directly\nexpressed in terms of transition probabilities, making it a more appropriate\nobservable for studying temporal quantum correlations in neutral meson systems.",

In the first part we argue,\nafter performing a survey of all potential dark matter particles in the MSSM,\nthat the (nearly) pure higgsino is the only candidate emerging virtually\nunscathed from the wealth of observational data of recent years. In doing so by\nvirtue of its gauge quantum numbers and electroweak symmetry breaking only, it\nmaintains at the same time a relatively high degree of model-independence. In\nthe second part we properly review the prospects for detection of a\nhiggsino-like neutralino in direct underground dark matter searches, collider\nsearches, and indirect astrophysical signals. We provide estimates for the\ntypical scale of the superpartners and fine tuning in the context of\ntraditional scenarios where the breaking of supersymmetry is mediated at about\nthe scale of Grand Unification and where strong expectations for a timely\ndetection of higgsinos in underground detectors are closely related to the\nmeasured 125 GeV mass of the Higgs boson at the LHC.",

Yet, the choice of the fields signalling spontaneous symmetry\nbreaking leads to disconnected subsets in the vacuum manifold related by the\n$D$-parity. The resulting domain walls, existing due to topological reasons but\nnot stable, are identified as topological pseudo-defects. We obtain a class of\none-parameter paths connecting $D$-parity flipped vacua and compute the energy\nbarrier height along the same. We consider the various patterns of symmetry\nbreaking which can result in either intermediate scale gauge groups or a\nsupersymmetric extension of the Standard Model. If the onset of inflation is\nsubsequent to GUT breaking, as could happen also if inflation is naturally\nexplained by the same GUT, the existence of such pseudo-defects can leave\nsignatures in the CMB.\n  Specifically, this could have an impact on the scale invariance of the CMB\nfluctuations and LSS data at the largest scale.",

    "summary": "A novel mechanism to produce and detect dark photons ($A^\\prime$) in\nexperiments making use of GeV electrons impinging on a thick target (beam-dump)\nis proposed. The positron-rich environment produced by the electromagnetic\nshowering allows to excite an $A^\\prime$ via non-resonant ($e^+ + e^- \\to\n\\gamma + A^\\prime$) and resonant ($e^+ + e^- \\to A^\\prime$) annihilation on\nquasi-at-rest atomic electrons. The latter mechanism, despite the large\nsuppression caused by the relationship between the resonance width and the\nsmall kinetic mixing parameter $\\varepsilon$, for some selected kinematics,\nresults in a larger sensitivity with respect to limits derived by the commonly\nused $A^\\prime-strahlung$. This idea, applied to the E137 experiment, pushes\nthe current limit on $\\varepsilon$ downwards by a factor of two for\n$m_{A^\\prime}$ in the range 35 MeV/c$^2$ - 120 MeV/c$^2$.",

    "summary": "The light Higgsino search is a crucial test for the criteria of the\nnaturalness in supersymmetry while at the same time, the direct production of\nlight Higgsino is also known as one of most challenging SUSY searches at the\nLHC. The lack of visible leptons due to the compressed spectrum and their small\nproduction rates limit their discovery potential in both mono-jet plus MET as\nwell as the weak boson fusion production. The signal prediction is usually\nwithin the background systematic uncertainties. We study the search of the\nlight Higgsinos at the future Large Hadron Electron Collider (LHeC) at CERN.\nThe light Higgsinos will be produced in pair through weak boson fusion with\ncontrolled background at this $e-p$ collider. For the Higgsino of 150 GeV, the\n$S/B$ ratio can be enhanced to be around 7%. However, due to the small\nproduction rate, the discovery still requires huge luminosity. We find the\nHiggsino of 135(155)~GeV can be reached at 2$\\sigma$ level with a luminosity\n$1(3)~\\text{ab}^{-1}$ respectively.",

    "summary": "The existence of CP-violation in the leptonic sector is one of the most\nimportant issues for modern science. Neutrino physics is a key to the solution\nof this problem. JUNO (under construction) is the near future of neutrino\nphysics. However CP-violation is not a priority for the current scientific\nprogram. We estimate the capability of $\\delta_{\\rm CP}$ measurement, assuming\na combination of the JUNO detector and a superconductive cyclotron as the\nantineutrino source. This method of measuring CP-violation is an alternative to\nconventional beam experiments. A significance level of 3$\\sigma$ can be reached\nfor 22% of the $\\delta_{\\rm CP}$ range. The accuracy of measurement lies\nbetween 8$^{\\rm o}$ and 22$^{\\rm o}$. It is shown that the dominant influence\non the result is the uncertainty in the mixing angle $\\Theta_{23}$.",

The direct implications of these theories are expected to be relevant\nfor cosmology and astrophysics. In the present work, we revisit the modified\nframework of the scalar-vector-tensor theories of gravity. Surprisingly, we\ndiscover novel metric function for the black hole solutions. We also\ninvestigate the semi-classical thermodynamics of the black holes and study the\nthermodynamic properties of the obtained solutions. Moreover, we quantify the\nentropy and the temperature of the new black hole. We calculate the heat\ncapacity and examine the possibility of the divergence points responsible for\nthe existence of the phase transition of the black hole. Finally, we also apply\nthe formalism of the geometrothermodynamics to examine thermodynamic properties\nof the new black hole. This formalism yields results consistent with those\nobtained from the usual thermodynamic implementation.",

On the other hand, there are heavy atomic nuclei\nthat feature extraordinary stability to spontaneous transmutations changing\ntheir mass numbers. The fact that extreme black holes and stable heavy nuclei\nshare a common trait, that of defying spontaneous ejection of their\nconstituents, suggests that a good part of nuclear physics can be modelled on\nphysics of extreme black holes through a simple version of gauge/gravity\nduality. We formulate a general criterion for discriminating between stable and\nunstable microscopic systems whereby a new insight into some still imperfectly\nunderstood phenomena, such as instability of truly neutral spinless particles\n(Higgs bosons, $\\pi_0$, quarkonia, glueballs), can be gained.",

    "summary": "Without any shred of evidence for new physics from LHC, the last hiding spots\nof natural electroweak supersymmetry seem to lie either in compressed spectra\nor in spectra where scalars are suppressed with respect to the gauginos. While\nin the MSSM (or in any theory where supersymmetry is broken by the $F$-vev of a\nchiral spurion), a hierarchy between scalar and gaugino masses requires special\nconstructions, it is automatic in scenarios where supersymmetry is broken by\n$D$-vev of a real spurion. In the latter framework, gaugino mediated\ncontributions to scalar soft masses are finite (loop suppressed but not\n$\\log$-enhanced), a feature often referred to as \"supersoftness\". Though\nphenomenologically attractive, pure supersoft models suffer from the\n$\\mu$-problem, potential color-breaking minima, large $T$-parameter, etc. These\nproblems can be overcome without sacrificing the model's virtues by departing\nfrom pure supersoftness and including $\\mu$-type operators that use the same\n$D$-vev, a framework known as generalized supersoft supersymmetry. The main\npurpose of this paper is to point out that the new operators also solve the\nlast remaining issue associated with supersoft spectra, namely that a right\nhanded (RH) slepton is predicted to be the lightest superpartner, rendering the\nsetup cosmologically unfeasible. In particular, we show that the\n$\\mu$-operators in generalized supersoft generate a new source for scalar\nmasses, which can raise the RH-slepton mass above bino due to corrections from\nrenormalisation group evolutions (RGEs). In fact, a mild tuning can open up the\nbino--RH slepton coannihilation regime for a thermal dark matter. We derive the\nfull set of RGEs required to determine the spectrum at low energies. Beginning\nwith input conditions at a high scale, we show that completely viable spectra\ncan be achieved.",

    "summary": "The nature of dark matter remains one of the key science questions. Weakly\nInteracting Massive Particles (WIMPs) are among the best motivated particle\nphysics candidates, allowing to explain the measured dark matter density by\nemploying standard big-bang thermodynamics. Examples include the lightest\nsupersymmetric particle, though many alternative particles have been suggested\nas a solution to the dark matter puzzle. We introduce here a radically new\nversion of the widely used DarkSUSY package, which allows to compute the\nproperties of such dark matter particles numerically. With DarkSUSY 6 one can\naccurately predict a large variety of astrophysical signals from dark matter,\nsuch as direct detection in low-background counting experiments and indirect\ndetection through antiprotons, antideuterons, gamma rays and positrons from the\nGalactic halo, or high-energy neutrinos from the center of the Earth or of the\nSun. For WIMPs, high-precision tools are provided for the computation of the\nrelic density in the Universe today, as well as for the size of the smallest\ndark matter protohalos. Compared to earlier versions, DarkSUSY 6 introduces\nmany significant physics improvements and extensions. The most fundamental new\nfeature of this release, however, is that the code has been completely\nre-organized and brought into a highly modular and flexible shape. Switching\nbetween different pre-implemented dark matter candidates has thus become\nstraight-forward, just as adding new -- WIMP or non-WIMP -- particle models or\nreplacing any given functionality in a fully user-specified way. In this\narticle, we describe the physics behind the computer package, along with the\nmain structure and philosophy of this major revision of DarkSUSY. A detailed\nmanual is provided together with the public release at http://www.darksusy.org.",

    "summary": "In a two Higgs doublet model (2HDM), at the vicinity of the alignment limit,\nthe extra contributions to the couplings of the SM-like Higgs with other\nparticles can be subdominant to the same coming from the six dimensional\noperators. In this context, we revisit the alignment limit itself. It is\ninvestigated to what extent these operators can mask the actual alignment in a\n2HDM. The bosonic operators which rescale the Higgs kinetic terms can lead to\nsubstantial change in the parameter space of the model. We find that some other\nbosonic operators, which are severely constrained from the electroweak\nprecision tests, can also modify the parameter space of 2HDM due to their\nanomalous momentum structures. A particular kind of Little Higgs model is\nexplored as an example of 2HDM effective field theory in connection with 2HDM\nalignment. Choosing a suitable benchmark point in a Type-II 2HDM, we highlight\nthe possibility that the exact alignment limit is ruled out at 95% CL in\npresence of such operators.",

In our approach we can get separate contributions of different $W$\nhelicities states. Several one- and two-dimensional differential distributions\nare shown and discussed. The present results are compared to the results of\nprevious calculations within collinear factorization approach. Similar results\nare found except of some observables such as e.g. transverse momentum of the\npair of $W^+$ and $W^-$. We find large contributions to the cross section from\nthe region of large photon virtualities. We show decomposition of the total\ncross section as well as invariant mass distribution into polarisation states\nof both W bosons.

We argue about the\norigin of the different quark masses without appealing for different ETC boson\nmasses, in one scenario where most of the new physics will appear in\ninteractions with the third fermion generation and with a TC scalar boson\npossibly lighter than the TC characteristic scale ($\\Lambda_{\\tt{TC}}$)",

    "summary": "Volkov states and Volkov propagator are the basic analytical tools to\ninvestigate QED processes occurring in the presence of an intense plane-wave\nelectromagnetic field. In the present paper we provide alternative and\nrelatively simple proofs of the completeness and of the orthonormality at a\nfixed time of the Volkov states. Concerning the completeness, we exploit some\nknown properties of the Green's function of the Dirac operator in a plane wave,\nwhereas the orthonormality of the Volkov states is proved, relying only on a\ngeometric argument based on the Gauss theorem in four dimensions. In relation\nwith the completeness of the Volkov states, we also study some analytical\nproperties of the Green's function of the Dirac operator in a plane wave, which\nwe explicitly prove to coincide with the Volkov propagator in configuration\nspace. In particular, a closed-form expression in terms of modified Bessel\nfunctions and Hankel functions is derived by means of the operator technique in\na plane wave and different asymptotic forms are determined. Finally, the\ntransformation properties of the Volkov propagator under general gauge\ntransformations and a general gauge-invariant expression of the so-called\ndressed mass in configuration space are presented.",

    "summary": "In this work we introduce RAPIDD, a surrogate model that speeds up the\ncomputation of the expected spectrum of dark matter particles in direct\ndetection experiments. RAPIDD replaces the exact calculation of the dark matter\ndifferential rate (which in general involves up to three nested integrals) with\na much faster parametrization in terms of ordinary polynomials of the dark\nmatter mass and couplings, obtained in an initial training phase. In this\narticle, we validate our surrogate model on the multi-dimensional parameter\nspace resulting from the effective field theory description of dark matter\ninteractions with nuclei, including also astrophysical uncertainties in the\ndescription of the dark matter halo. As a concrete example, we use this tool to\nstudy the complementarity of different targets to discriminate simplified dark\nmatter models. We demonstrate that RAPIDD is fast and accurate, and\nparticularly well-suited to explore a multi-dimensional parameter space, such\nas the one in effective field theory approach, and scans with a large number of\nevaluations.",

    "summary": "A search is presented for photonic signatures, motivated by generalized\nmodels of gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking. This search makes use of\nproton-proton collision data at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV corresponding to an\nintegrated luminosity of 36.1 fb$^{-1}$ recorded by the ATLAS detector at the\nLHC, and explores models dominated by both strong and electroweak production of\nsupersymmetric partner states. Experimental signatures incorporating an\nisolated photon and significant missing transverse momentum are explored. These\nsignatures include events with an additional photon or additional jet activity\nnot associated with any specific underlying quark flavor. No significant excess\nof events is observed above the Standard Model prediction, and 95%\nconfidence-level upper limits of between 0.083 fb and 0.32 fb are set on the\nvisible cross section of contributions from physics beyond the Standard Model.\nThese results are interpreted in terms of lower limits on the masses of\ngluinos, squarks, and gauginos in the context of generalized models of\ngauge-mediated supersymmetry, which reach as high as 2.3 TeV for strongly\nproduced and 1.3 TeV for weakly produced supersymmetric partner pairs.",

    "summary": "It has been considered that baryogenesis models without a generation of\n$B$-$L$ asymmetry such as the GUT baryogenesis do not work since the asymmetry\nis washed out by the electroweak sphalerons. Here we point out that helical\nhypermagnetic fields can be generated through the chiral magnetic effect with a\nchiral asymmetry generated in such baryogenesis models. The helical\nhypermagnetic fields then produce baryon asymmetry mainly at the electroweak\nsymmetry breaking, which remains until today. Therefore the baryogenesis models\nwithout $B$-$L$ asymmetry can still be the origin of the present baryon\nasymmetry. In particular, if it can produce chiral asymmetry mainly carried by\nright-handed electrons of order of $10^{-3}$ in terms of the chemical potential\nto temperature ratio, the resultant present-day baryon asymmetry can be\nconsistent with our Universe, although simple realizations of the GUT\nbaryogenesis are hard to satisfy the condition. We also argue the way to\novercome the difficulty in the GUT baryogenesis. The intergalactic magnetic\nfields with $B_0\\sim 10^{-16 \\sim 17}$ G and $\\lambda_0 \\sim 10^{-2\\sim3}$ pc\nare the smoking-gun of the baryogenesis scenario as discussed before.",

    "summary": "The cosmic-ray flux of antiprotons is measured with high precision by the\nspace-borne particle spectrometers AMS-02.Its interpretation requires a correct\ndescription of the dominant production process for antiprotons in our Galaxy,\nnamely, the interaction of cosmic-ray proton and helium with the interstellar\nmedium. In the light of new cross section measurements by the NA61 experiment\nof $p + p \\rightarrow \\bar{p} + X$ and the first ever measurement of $p +\n\\mathrm{He} \\rightarrow \\bar{p} + X$ by the LHCb experiment, we update the\nparametrization of proton-proton and proton-nucleon cross sections.We find that\nthe LHCb $p$He data constrain a shape for the cross section at high energies\nand show for the first time how well the rescaling from the $pp$ channel\napplies to a helium target. By using $pp$, $p$He and $p$C data we estimate the\nuncertainty on the Lorentz invariant cross section for $p + \\mathrm{He}\n\\rightarrow \\bar{p} + X$. We use these new cross sections to compute the source\nterm for all the production channels, considering also nuclei heavier than He\nboth in cosmic rays and the interstellar medium. The uncertainties on the total\nsource term is at the level of $\\pm20$% and slightly increase below antiproton\nenergies of 5 GeV. This uncertainty is dominated by $p+p \\rightarrow \\bar{p} +\nX$ cross section, which translates into all channels since we derive them using\nthe $pp$ cross sections. The cross sections to calculate the source spectra\nfrom all relevant cosmic-ray isotopes are provided in the supplementary. We\nfinally quantify the necessity of new data on antiproton production cross\nsections, and pin down the kinematic parameter space which should be covered by\nfuture data.",

In this work we\nrevisit the impact of direct photon production on a global PDF analysis,\nmotivated by the recent availability of the next-to-next-to-leading (NNLO)\ncalculation for this process. We demonstrate that the inclusion of NNLO QCD and\nleading-logarithmic electroweak corrections leads to a good quantitative\nagreement with the ATLAS measurements at 8 TeV and 13 TeV, except for the most\nforward rapidity region in the former case. By including the ATLAS 8 TeV direct\nphoton production data in the NNPDF3.1 NNLO global analysis, we assess its\nimpact on the medium-x gluon. We also study the constraining power of the\ndirect photon production measurements on PDF fits based on different datasets,\nin particular on the NNPDF3.1 no-LHC and collider-only fits. We also present\nupdated NNLO theoretical predictions for direct photon production at 13 TeV\nthat include the constraints from the 8 TeV measurements.",

    "summary": "The coloron, a massive version of the gluon present in gauge extensions of\nQCD, has been searched for at the LHC as a dijet or top quark pair resonance.\nWe point out that in the Renormalizable Coloron Model (ReCoM) with a minimal\nfield content to break the gauge symmetry, a color-octet scalar and a singlet\nscalar are naturally lighter than the coloron because they are pseudo\nNambu-Goldstone bosons. Consequently, the coloron may predominantly decay into\nscalar pairs, leading to novel signatures at the LHC. When the color-octet\nscalar is lighter than the singlet, or when the singlet mass is above roughly 1\nTeV, the signatures consist of multi-jet resonances of multiplicity up to 12,\nincluding topologies with multi-prong jet substructure, slightly displaced\nvertices, and sometimes a top quark pair. When the singlet is the lightest\nReCoM boson and lighter than about 1 TeV, its main decays ($W^+W^-$, $\\gamma\nZ$, $ZZ$) arise at three loops. The LHC signatures then involve two or four\nboosted electroweak bosons, often originating from highly displaced vertices,\nplus one or two pairs of prompt jets or top quarks.",

    "summary": "We present a next-to-leading order calculation of H+jet in gluon fusion\nincluding the effect of a finite top quark mass $m_t$ at large transverse\nmomenta. Using the recently published two-loop amplitudes in the high energy\nexpansion and our previous setup that includes finite $m_t$ effects in a low\nenergy expansion, we are able to obtain $m_t$-finite results for transverse\nmomenta below 225 GeV and above 500 GeV with negligible remaining top quark\nmass uncertainty. The only remaining region that has to rely on the common\nleading order rescaling approach is the threshold region $\\sqrt{\\hat s}\\simeq\n2m_t$. We demonstrate that this rescaling provides an excellent approximation\nin the high $p_T$ region. Our calculation settles the issue of top quark mass\neffects at large transverse momenta. It is implemented in the parton level\nMonte Carlo code MCFM and is publicly available immediately in version 8.2.",

In this framework, we investigate patterns of the electroweak phase\ntransition as well as those of the dark phase transition, and examine\ndetectability of gravitational waves (GWs) generated by such strongly first\norder phase transition. It is pointed out that the collider bounds on the\nproperties of the discovered Higgs boson exclude a part of parameter space that\ncould otherwise generate detectable GWs. After imposing various constraints on\nthis model, it is shown that GWs produced by multi-step phase transitions are\ndetectable at future space-based interferometers, such as LISA and DECIGO, if\nthe dark photon is heavier than 25 GeV. Furthermore, we discuss the\ncomplementarity of dark photon searches or dark matter searches with the GW\nobservations in these models with the dark gauge symmetry.",

    "summary": "We performed systematic studies for the effects of event-by-event efficiency\nfluctuations on efficiency correction for cumulant analysis in relativistic\nheavy-ion collision experiments. Experimentally, particle efficiencies of\nevents measured with different experimental conditions should be different. For\nfluctuation measurements, the final event-by-event multiplicity distributions\nshould be the superposed distributions of various type of events measured under\ndifferent conditions.We demonstrate the efficiency fluctuation effects in a\nnumerical simulation, in which we construct an event ensemble consists of\nevents with two different efficiencies. By using the mean particle\nefficiencies, we find the efficiency corrected cumulants show large deviations\nfrom the original inputs when the discrepancy of the two efficiencies are\nlarge. We further studied the effects of efficiency fluctuations for the\ncumulants of net-proton distributions by implementing the UrQMD events of Au+Au\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=7.7$ GeV in a realistic STAR detector acceptance.\nWe consider the unequal efficiency in two sides of the Time Projection Chamber\n(TPC), multiplicity dependent efficiency and the event-by-event variations of\nthe collision vertex position along the longitudinal direction\n($V_\\mathrm{z}$). When the efficiencies fluctuate dramatically within the\nstudied event sample, the effects of efficiency fluctuations have significant\nimpacts on the efficiency corrections of cumulants with the mean efficiencies.\nWe find that this effect can be effectively suppressed by binning the entire\nevent ensemble into various sub-event samples, in which the efficiency\nvariations are relative small. The final efficiency corrected cumulants can be\ncalculated from the weighted average of the corrected factorial moments of the\nsub-event samples with the mean efficiencies.",

    "summary": "The SoLid collaboration has developed a new detector technology to detect\nelectron anti-neutrinos at close proximity to the Belgian BR2 reactor at\nsurface level. A 288$\\,$kg prototype detector was deployed in 2015 and\ncollected data during the operational period of the reactor and during reactor\nshut-down. Dedicated calibration campaigns were also performed with gamma and\nneutron sources.\n  This paper describes the construction of the prototype detector with a high\ncontrol on its proton content and the stability of its operation over a period\nof several months after deployment at the BR2 reactor site. All detector cells\nprovide sufficient light yields to achieve a target energy resolution of better\nthan 20%/$\\sqrt{E(MeV)}$. The capability of the detector to track muons is\nexploited to equalize the light response of a large number of channels to a\nprecision of 3% and to demonstrate the stability of the energy scale over time.\nParticle identification based on pulse-shape discrimination is demonstrated\nwith calibration sources. Despite a lower neutron detection efficiency due to\ntriggering constraints, the main backgrounds at the reactor site were\ndetermined and taken into account in the shielding strategy for the main\nexperiment. The results obtained with this prototype proved essential in the\ndesign optimization of the final detector.\n  This paper is dedicated to our SCK$\\cdot$CEN colleague, Edgar Koonen, who\npassed away unexpectedly in 2017. Edgar was part of the SoLid collaboration\nsince its inception and his efforts were vital to get the experiment started.\nHe will be duly missed.",

The bounds arise from a\nscale-dependent analysis of gravitational catalysis and its influence on the\neffective potential for the chiral order parameter, as induced by fermionic\nfluctuations on a curved spacetime with local hyperbolic properties. The bound\nis expressed in terms of the local curvature scalar measured in units of a\ngauge-invariant coarse-graining scale. We argue that any effective field theory\nof quantum gravity obeying this curvature bound is safe from chiral symmetry\nbreaking through gravitational catalysis and thus compatible with the\nsimultaneous existence of chiral fermions in the low-energy spectrum. With\nincreasing number of dimensions, the curvature bound in terms of the hyperbolic\nscale parameter becomes stronger. Applying the curvature bound to the\nasymptotic safety scenario for quantum gravity in four spacetime dimensions\ntranslates into bounds on the matter content of particle physics models.",

    "summary": "We study the influence of a background magnetic field on the $J/\\psi$ vector\nmeson in a DBI-extension of the soft wall model, building upon our earlier work\nPhys. Rev. D91, 086002 (2015). In this specific holographic QCD model, we\ndiscuss the heavy quark number susceptibility and diffusion constants of charm\nquarks and their dependence on the magnetic field by either a hydrodynamic\nexpansion or by numerically solving the differential equation. This allows us\nto determine the response of these transport coefficients to the magnetic\nfield. The effects of the latter are considered both from a direct as indirect\n(medium) viewpoint. As expected, we find a magnetic field induced anisotropic\ndiffusion, with a stronger diffusion in the longitudinal direction compared to\nthe transversal one. We backup, at least qualitatively, our findings with a\nhanging string analysis of heavy quark diffusion in a magnetic field. From the\nquark number susceptibility we can extract an estimate for the effective\ndeconfinement temperature in the heavy quark sector, reporting consistency with\nthe phenomenon of inverse magnetic catalysis.",

    "summary": "On general grounds based on quantum field theory the decay amplitude for\n$\\Sigma^0 \\to \\Lambda \\gamma$ consists of a parity conserving magnetic and a\nparity violating electric dipole transition moment. Because of the subsequent\nself-analyzing weak decay of the $\\Lambda$ hyperon the interference between\nmagnetic and electric dipole transition moment leads to an asymmetry in the\nangular distribution. Comparing the decay distributions for the $\\Sigma^0$\nhyperon and its antiparticle gives access to possible C and CP violation. Based\non flavor SU(3) symmetry the present upper limit on the neutron electric dipole\nmoment can be translated to an upper limit for the angular asymmetry. It turns\nout to be far below any experimental resolution that one can expect in the\nforeseeable future. Thus any true observation of a CP violating angular\nasymmetry would constitute physics beyond the standard model, even if extended\nby a CP violating QCD theta-vacuum-angle term.",

    "summary": "The Gleyzes-Langlois-Piazza-Vernizzi (GLPV) theories up to quartic order are\nthe general scheme of scalar-tensor theories allowing the possibility for\nrealizing the tensor propagation speed $c_t$ equivalent to 1 on the isotropic\ncosmological background. We propose a dark energy model in which the late-time\ncosmic acceleration occurs by a simple k-essence Lagrangian analogous to the\nghost condensate with cubic and quartic Galileons in the framework of GLPV\ntheories. We show that a wide variety of the variation of the dark energy\nequation of state $w_{\\rm DE}$ including the entry to the region $w_{\\rm\nDE}<-1$ can be realized without violating conditions for the absence of ghosts\nand Laplacian instabilities. The approach to the tracker equation of state\n$w_{\\rm DE}=-2$ during the matter era, which is disfavored by observational\ndata, can be avoided by the existence of a quadratic k-essence Lagrangian\n$X^2$. We study the evolution of nonrelativistic matter perturbations for the\nmodel $c_t^2=1$ and show that the two quantities $\\mu$ and $\\Sigma$, which are\nrelated to the Newtonian and weak lensing gravitational potentials\nrespectively, are practically equivalent to each other, such that $\\mu \\simeq\n\\Sigma>1$. For the case in which the deviation of $w_{\\rm DE}$ from $-1$ is\nsignificant at a later cosmological epoch, the values of $\\mu$ and $\\Sigma$\ntend to be larger at low redshifts. We also find that our dark energy model can\nbe consistent with the bounds on the deviation parameter $\\alpha_{\\rm H}$ from\nHorndeski theories arising from the modification of gravitational law inside\nmassive objects.",

We observe that at small-$x$,\nthe gluon helicity and orbital angular momentum distributions are roughly of\nthe same magnitude but with opposite signs, indicating a significant\ncancellation between them. A similar cancellation occurs also in the quark\nsector. We explain analytically the reason for this cancellation.",

    "summary": "A compact method for amplitude calculations in theories with Dirac and\nMajorana effective operators is discussed. Using the renormalizable formalism\nof Denner et al., [1,2] for propagators, vertices and fermion (number) flow and\nintroducing new \"reading-rules\", it is shown that fermions can be treated as\nscalars in the diagrams. The effect of Fermi-statistics appears only in overall\nsigns and is determined once for whole classes of diagrams. Each vertex in this\nmethod corresponds to two or more vertices in the standard treatment of\neffective theories. As such, the advantages of this approach grow together with\nthe number of four-fermion vertices in a given diagram. The discussion develops\naround effective field theories based on the Standard Model, up to\nfour-fermions and to any order in perturbation theory. Even so, the framework\nis more general and can be applied elsewhere.",

    "summary": "Wilson lines capture important features of scattering amplitudes, for example\nsoft effects relevant for infrared divergences, and the Regge limit. Beyond the\nleading power approximation, corrections to the eikonal picture have to be\ntaken into account. In this paper, we study such corrections in a model of\nmassive scattering amplitudes in N = 4 super Yang-Mills, in the planar limit,\nwhere the mass is generated through a Higgs mechanism. Using known three-loop\nanalytic expressions for the scattering amplitude, we find that the first power\nsuppressed term has a very simple form, equal to a single power law. We propose\nthat its exponent is governed by the anomalous dimension of a Wilson loop with\na scalar inserted at the cusp, and we provide perturbative evidence for this\nproposal. We also analyze other limits of the amplitude and conjecture an exact\nformula for a total cross-section at high energies.",

    "summary": "Using vacuum domain structure model, trivial static potentials in various\nrepresentations of $F_4$, $E_6$ and $G_2$ exceptional groups are calculated by\nmeans of the unit center element. Due to the absence of the non-trivial center\nelements, the potential of every representation is screened at far distances.\nHowever, the linear part is observed at intermediate quark separations which is\ninvestigated by the decomposition of the exceptional group to its maximal\nsubgroups. Comparing the group factor of the super-group with the corresponding\none obtained from the non-trivial center elements of $SU(3)$ subgroup, shows\nthat $SU(3)$ is not the direct cause of temporary confinement in any of the\nexceptional groups. However, the trivial potential obtained from the group\ndecomposition to the $SU(3)$ subgroup is the same as the potential of the\nsuper-group itself. In addition, any regular or singular decomposition to the\n$SU(2)$ subgroup which produces the Cartan generator with the same elements as\n$h_1$, in any exceptional group, leads to the linear intermediate potential of\nthe exceptional gauge groups. The other $SU(2)$ decompositions with the Cartan\ngenerator different from $h_1$, are still able to describe the linear potential\nif the number of $SU(2)$ non-trivial center element which emerge in the\ndecompositions is the same. As a result, it is the center vortices quantized in\nterms of non-trivial center element of the $SU(2)$ subgroup which give rise to\nthe intermediate confinement in the static potentials.",

    "summary": "The evaluation of multi-loop Feynman integrals is one of the main challenges\nin the computation of precise theoretical predictions for the cross sections\nmeasured at the LHC. In recent years, the method of differential equations has\nproven to be a powerful tool for the computation of Feynman integrals. It has\nbeen observed that the differential equation of Feynman integrals can in many\ninstances be transformed into a so-called canonical form, which significantly\nsimplifies its integration in terms of iterated integrals. The main result of\nthis thesis is an algorithm to compute rational transformations of differential\nequations of Feynman integrals into a canonical form. Apart from requiring the\nexistence of such a rational transformation, the algorithm needs no further\nassumptions about the differential equation. In particular, it is applicable to\nproblems depending on multiple kinematic variables and also allows for a\nrational dependence on the dimensional regulator. First, the transformation law\nis expanded in the dimensional regulator to derive differential equations for\nthe coefficients of the transformation. Using an ansatz in terms of rational\nfunctions, these differential equations are then solved to determine the\ntransformation. This thesis also presents an implementation of the algorithm in\nthe Mathematica package CANONICA, which is the first publicly available program\nto compute transformations to a canonical form for differential equations\ndepending on multiple variables. The main functionality and its usage are\nillustrated with some simple examples. Furthermore, the package is applied to\nstate-of-the-art integral topologies appearing in recent multi-loop\ncalculations. These topologies depend on up to three variables and include\npreviously unknown topologies contributing to higher-order corrections to the\ncross section of single top-quark production at the LHC.",

Two sets of the nuclear\nstructure parametrization have been explored, and the difference between the\ntwo isobaric collisions appears to be small, in terms of $dN/d\\eta$, $p_T$\nspectra and $v_2$ for charged particles. We mimic the CME by introducing an\ninitial charge separation that is proportional to the magnetic field produced\nin the collision, and study how the final-state interactions affect the CME\nobservables. The relative difference in the CME signal between the two isobaric\ncollisions is found to be robust, insensitive to the final-state interactions.",

    "summary": "We perform model-independent analyses extracting limits for the electric\ndipole moment of the electron and the P,T-odd scalar-pseudoscalar (S-PS)\nnucleon-electron coupling from the most recent measurements with atoms and\nmolecules. The analysis using paramagnetic systems, only, is improved\nsubstantially by the inclusion of the recent measurement on HfF+ ions, but\ncomplicated by the fact that the corresponding constraints are largely aligned,\nowing to a general relation between the coefficients for the two contributions.\nSince this same relation does not hold in diamagnetic systems, it is possible\nto find atoms that provide essentially orthogonal constraints to those from\npara\\-magnetic ones. However, the coefficients are suppressed in closed-shell\nsystems and enhancements of P,T-odd effects are only prevalent in the presence\nof hyperfine interactions. We formulate the hyperfine-induced\ntime-reversal-symmetry breaking S-PS nucleon-electron interaction in general\natoms in a mixed perturbative and variational approach, based on electronic\nDirac-wavefunctions including the effects of electron correlations. The method\nis applied to the Hg atom, yielding the first direct calculation of the\ncoefficient of the S-PS nucleon-electron coupling in a diamagnetic system. This\nresults in additionally improved model-independent limits for both the electron\nEDM and the nucleon-electron coupling from the global fit. Finally we employ\nthis fit to provide indirect limits for several paramagnetic systems under\ninvestigation.",

    "summary": "A search for supersymmetry (SUSY) is performed in final states comprising one\nor more jets and missing transverse momentum using data from proton-proton\ncollisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The data were recorded with\nthe CMS detector at the CERN LHC in 2016 and correspond to an integrated\nluminosity of 35.9 fb$^{-1}$. The number of signal events is found to agree\nwith the expected background yields from standard model processes. The results\nare interpreted in the context of simplified models of SUSY that assume the\nproduction of gluino or squark pairs and their prompt decay to quarks and the\nlightest neutralino. The masses of bottom, top, and mass-degenerate\nlight-flavour squarks are probed up to 1050, 1000, and 1325 GeV, respectively.\nThe gluino mass is probed up to 1900, 1650, and 1650 GeV when the gluino decays\nvia virtual states of the aforementioned squarks. The strongest mass bounds on\nthe neutralinos from gluino and squark decays are 1150 and 575 GeV,\nrespectively. The search also provides sensitivity to simplified models\ninspired by split SUSY that involve the production and decay of long-lived\ngluinos. Values of the proper decay length $c\\tau$ from $10^{-3}$ to $10^{5}$\nmm are considered, as well as a metastable gluino scenario. Gluino masses up to\n1750 and 900 GeV are probed for $c\\tau =$ 1 mm and for the metastable state,\nrespectively. The sensitivity is moderately dependent on model assumptions for\n$c\\tau \\gtrsim 1$ m.

We highlight the role of different\npartonic subprocesses within the two isolation criteria, and we show that they\nproduce large radiative corrections for both criteria. Smooth cone isolation is\na consistent procedure to compute QCD radiative corrections at NLO and beyond.\nIf photon isolation is sufficiently tight, we show that the NLO results for the\ntwo isolation procedures are consistent with each other within their\nperturbative uncertainties. We then extend our study to NNLO by using smooth\ncone isolation. We discuss the impact of the NNLO corrections and the\ncorresponding perturbative uncertainties for both fiducial cross sections and\ndistributions, and we comment on the comparison with some LHC data. Throughout\nour study we remark the main features that are produced by the kinematical\nselection cuts that are applied to the photons. In particular, we examine\nsoft-gluon singularities that appear in the perturbative computations of the\ninvariant mass distribution of the photon pair, the transverse-momentum spectra\nof the photons, and the fiducial cross section with asymmetric and symmetric\nphoton transverse-momentum cuts, and we present their behaviour in analytic\nform.",

    "summary": "The letter submitted is an executive summary of our previous paper. To solve\nthe Einstein Podolsky Rosen 'paradox' the two boundary quantum mechanics is\ntaken as self consistent interpretation of quantum dynamics. The difficulty\nwith this interpretation is to reconcile it with classical physics. To avoid\nmacroscopic backward causation two 'corresponding transition rules' are\nformulated which specify needed properties of macroscopic observations and\nmanipulations. The apparent classical causal decision tree requires to\nunderstand the classically unchosen options. They are taken to occur with an\n'incomplete knowledge' of the boundary states typically in macroscopic\nconsiderations. The precise boundary conditions with given phases then select\nthe actual measured path and this selection is mistaken to happen at the time\nof measurement. The apparent time direction of the decision tree originates in\nan assumed relative proximity to the initial state. Only the far away final\nstate allows for classically distinct options to be selected from.\nCosmologically the picture could correspond to a big bang initial and a hugely\nextended final state scenario. It is speculated that it might also hold for a\nbig bang/big crunch world. If this would be the case the Born probability\npostulate could find a natural explanation if we coexist in the expanding and\nthe correlated CPT conjugate contracting world.",

    "summary": "The fraction of heavy vector mesons detected after a heavy ion collision\nprovides information about the possible formation of a plasma state. An\ninteresting framework for estimating the degree of dissociation of heavy mesons\nin a plasma is the holographic approach. It has been recently shown that a\nconsistent picture for the thermal behavior of charmonium and bottomonium\nstates in a thermal medium emerges from holographic bottom up models. A crucial\ningredient in this new approach is the appropriate description of decay\nconstants, since they are related to the heights of the quasiparticle peaks of\nthe finite temperature spectral function. Here we extend this new holographic\nmodel in order to study the effect of magnetic fields on the thermal spectrum\nof heavy mesons. The motivation is that very large magnetic fields are present\nin non central heavy ion collisions and this could imply a change in the\ndissociation scenario. The thermal spectra of $ c \\bar c$ and $ b \\bar b \\, $ S\nwave states is obtained for different temperatures and different values of the\nmagnetic $e B$ field.",

    "summary": "The ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) measures charged\nhadron spectra obtained in 2010 and 2011 lead-lead LHC data taking periods with\ntotal integrated statistics of 0.15nb${}^{-1}$. The results are compared to the\n$pp$ spectra of charged hadrons at the same centre-of-mass energy based on the\ndata sample with integrated luminosity of 4.2pb${}^{-1}$ obtained by the ATLAS\nexperiment in 2011 and 2013. This allows a detailed comparison of the two\ncollision systems in a wide transverse momentum ($0.5<p_{\\mathrm{T}}<150$GeV)\nand pseudorapidity ($|\\eta|<2$) ranges in different centrality intervals of\nPb+Pb collision. The nuclear modification factor $R_{\\mathrm{AA}}$ is presented\nin detail as a function of centrality, $p_{\\mathrm{T}}$ and $\\eta$. It shows a\ndistinct $p_{\\mathrm{T}}$-dependence with a pronounced minimum at about 7GeV.\nAbove 60GeV, it is consistent with a flat, centrality-dependent, value within\nthe uncertainties. The value is $0.55\\pm0.01(stat.)\\pm0.04(syst.)$ in the most\ncentral collisions. The $R_{\\mathrm{AA}}$ is observed to be consistent with\nflat $|\\eta|$ dependence over the whole transverse momentum range in all\ncentrality classes.",

The parameters of\nthe model are determined by matching the meson and quark masses, as well as the\npion decay constant to their physical values using the on-shell and modified\nminimal subtraction schemes. In this paper, we study the possibility of\ndifferent phases at zero temperature. In particular, we investigate the\ncompetition between an inhomogeneous chiral condensate and a pion condensate.\nFor the inhomogeneity, we use a chiral-density wave ansatz. For a sigma mass of\n$600$ MeV, we find that an inhomogeneous chiral condensate exist only for pion\nmasses below approximately 37 MeV.

The experimental results show that Gallium-doped LGADs\nare more heavily affected by initial acceptor removal than Boron-doped LGAD,\nwhile the presence of Carbon reduces initial acceptor removal both for Gallium\nand Boron doping. Boron low-diffusion shows a higher radiation resistance than\nthat of standard Boron implant, indicating a dependence of the initial acceptor\nremoval mechanism upon the implant width. This study also demonstrates that\nproton irradiation is at least twice more effective in producing initial\nacceptor removal, making proton irradiation far more damaging than neutron\nirradiation.",

    "summary": "The clockwork mechanism would be completely spoiled by the presence of a\ncosmological constant in the bulk of its 5D construction, or by analogous terms\nin the discrete case. It is believed that supersymmetry is required to forbid\nthe appearance of these fatal terms, thus apparently tying the fate of the\nclockwork to the presence of supersymmetry. In this letter we argue that a\nrobust clockwork can be obtained also without supersymmetry, by providing a\nmodel for the clockwork/linear dilaton EFT where this protection is instead\nrelated to diffeomorphism invariance in a higher number of extra dimensions. We\nshow that the clockwork mechanism is a quite general setup that emerges, rather\nminimally, from pure gravity in the presence of $D-5$ additional flat extra\ndimensions. The linear dilaton model is obtained asymptotically in the limit of\ninfinitely many extra dimensions. We then study the finite-$D$ theory, which is\na deformation of the linear dilaton one, but still a clockwork theory for $D$\nlarge enough.",

    "summary": "The cross section for back-to-back hadron pair production in $e^+e^-$\nannihilation provides access to the dihadron fragmentation functions (DiFF)\nneeded to extract nucleon parton distribution functions from the semi-inclusive\ndeep inelastic scattering (SIDIS) experiments with two detected final state\nhadrons. Particular attention is given to the so-called interference DiFF\n(IFF), which makes it possible to extract the transversity parton distribution\nof the nucleon in the collinear framework. However, previously unnoticed\ndiscrepancies were recently highlighted between the definitions of the IFFs\nappearing in the collinear kinematics when reconstructed from DiFFs entering\nthe unintegrated fully differential cross sections of SIDIS and $e^+e^-$\nannihilation processes. In this work, to clarify this problem we re-derive the\nfully differential cross section for $e^+e^-$ annihilation at the leading-twist\napproximation. We find a mistake in the definition of the kinematics in the\noriginal expression that systematically affects a subset of terms and that\nleads to two significant consequences. First, the discrepancy between the IFF\ndefinitions in the cross sections for SIDIS and $e^+e^-$ annihilation is\nresolved. Second, the previously derived azimuthal asymmetry for accessing the\nhelicity dependent DiFF $G_1^\\perp$ in $e^+e^-$ annihilation vanishes, which\nexplains the non-observation of this asymmetry in the recent experimental\nsearches by the ${\\tt BELLE}$ collaboration. We discuss the recently proposed\nalternative option to extract $G_1^\\perp$.",

We show how it comes to be\ngenerated in dimensional renormalization, using a basis of 13 form factors (the\n$F$-basis), where only one of them requires renormalization $(F_{13})$,\nextending previous studies. We then combine recent results on the structure of\nthe non-perturbative solutions of the conformal Ward identities (CWI's) for the\n$TJJ$ in momentum space, expressed in terms of a minimal set of 4 form factors\n($A-$ basis), with the properties of the $F$-basis, and show how the singular\nbehaviour of the corresponding form factors in both basis can be related. The\nresult proves the centrality of such massless effective interactions induced by\nthe anomaly, which have recently found realization in solid state, in the\ntheory of topological insulators and of Weyl semimetals. This pattern is\nconfirmed in massless abelian and nonabelian theories (QED and QCD)\ninvestigated at one-loop.",

The experimental data and recent theoretical studies on their\nmass allow us to interpret them as spin-3/2 negative-parity and spin-5/2\npositive-parity pentaquarks, respectively. There may exist opposite-parity\nstates corresponding to these particles, as well. Despite a lot of studies,\nhowever, the nature and organization of these pentaquarks in terms of quarks\nand gluons are not clear. To this end we need more theoretical investigations\non other physical properties of these states. In this accordance, we study a\nstrong and dominant decay of the $P_c(4380)$ to $J/\\psi$ and $N$ in the\nframework of three point QCD sum rule method. An interpolating current in a\nmolecular form is applied to calculate six strong coupling form factors\ndefining the transitions of the positive and negative parity spin-3/2\npentaquark states. The results of the coupling constants are used in the\ncalculation of the decay widths of these transitions. The obtained result for\nthe decay with of the negative parity state is compatible with the experimental\nobservation. Our prediction for the width of the opposite-parity state's\ntransition may help experimentalists in the search for the possible positive\nparity spin-3/2 pentaquark of $\\bar{c}cduu$.",

    "summary": "The high design luminosity of the SuperKEKB electron-positron collider is\nexpected to result in challenging levels of beam-induced backgrounds in the\ninteraction region. Properly simulating and mitigating these backgrounds is\ncritical to the success of the Belle~II experiment. We report on measurements\nperformed with a suite of dedicated beam background detectors, collectively\nknown as BEAST II, during the so-called Phase 1 commissioning run of SuperKEKB\nin 2016, which involved operation of both the high energy ring (HER) of 7 GeV\nelectrons as well as the low energy ring (LER) of 4 GeV positrons. We describe\nthe BEAST II detector systems, the simulation of beam backgrounds, and the\nmeasurements performed. The measurements include standard ones of dose rates\nversus accelerator conditions, and more novel investigations, such as\nbunch-by-bunch measurements of injection backgrounds and measurements sensitive\nto the energy spectrum and angular distribution of fast neutrons. We observe\nbeam-gas, Touschek, beam-dust, and injection backgrounds. We do not observe\nsignificant synchrotron radiation, as expected. Measured LER beam-gas\nbackgrounds and Touschek backgrounds in both rings are slightly elevated, on\naverage three times larger than the levels predicted by simulation. HER\nbeam-gas backgrounds are on on average two orders of magnitude larger than\npredicted. Systematic uncertainties and channel-to-channel variations are\nlarge, so that these excesses constitute only 1-2 sigma level effects. Neutron\nbackground rates are higher than predicted and should be studied further. We\nwill measure the remaining beam background processes, due to colliding beams,\nin the imminent commissioning Phase 2. These backgrounds are expected to be the\nmost critical for Belle II, to the point of necessitating replacement of\ndetector components during the Phase 3 (full-luminosity) operation of SuperKEB.",

    "summary": "We present {\\tt GKG18-DPDFs}, a next-to-leading order (NLO) QCD analysis of\ndiffractive parton distribution functions (diffractive PDFs) and their\nuncertainties. This is the first global set of diffractive PDFs determined\nwithin the {\\tt xFitter} framework. This analysis is motivated by all available\nand most up-to-date data on inclusive diffractive deep inelastic scattering\n(diffractive DIS). Heavy quark contributions are considered within the\nframework of the `TR' general mass variable flavor number scheme (GM-VFNS). We\nform a mutually consistent set of diffractive PDFs due to the inclusion of\nhigh-precision data from H1/ZEUS combined inclusive diffractive cross sections\nmeasurements. We study the impact of the H1/ZEUS combined data by producing a\nvariety of determinations based on reduced data sets. We find that these data\nsets have a significant impact on the diffractive PDFs with some substantial\nreductions in uncertainties. The predictions based on the extracted diffractive\nPDFs are compared to the analyzed diffractive DIS data and with other\ndeterminations of the diffractive PDFs.",

We have exploited quenched gauge field\nconfigurations, $N_f=0$, with both Wilson and tree-level Symanzik improved\nactions, and unquenched ones with $N_f=2+1$ and $N_f=2+1+1$ dynamical flavors\n(domain wall and twisted-mass fermions, respectively).\n  We show that the dominance of instanton correlations on the low-momenta gluon\nGreen functions can be applied to the determination of phenomenological\nparameters of the instanton liquid and, eventually, to a determination of the\nlattice spacing.\n  We furthermore apply the Gradient Flow to remove short-distance fluctuations.\nThe Gradient Flow gets rid of the QCD scale, $\\Lambda_{\\rm QCD}$, and reveals\nthat the instanton prediction extents to large momenta. For those gauge field\nconfigurations free of quantum fluctuations, the direct study of topological\ncharge density shows the appearance of large-scale lumps that can be identified\nas instantons, giving access to a direct study of the instanton density and\nsize distribution that is compatible with those extracted from the analysis of\nthe Green functions.",

    "summary": "The multiple-solution problem in determining the\nthree-interfering-resonances' parameters from a fit to an experimentally\nmeasured distribution is considered in a mathematical viewpoint. In this paper\nit is shown that there are four numerical solutions for the fit with three\ncoherent Breit-Wigner functions. Although the explicit analytical formulae can\nnot be derived in this case, we provide some constraint equations between the\nfour solutions. For the cases of nonrelativistic and relativistic Breit-Wigner\nforms of amplitude functions, numerical method is provided to derive the other\nsolutions from the already obtained one based on the obtained constraint\nequations. In real experimental measurements with more complicated amplitude\nforms similar to Breit-Wigner functions, the same method can be deduced and\nperformed to get numerical solutions. The well agreement between the solved\nsolutions using this mathematical method and those from the fit directly\nverifies the correctness of the supplied constraint equations and mathematical\nmethodology.",

Is this paper, besides the PCAC relation\nand the low-energy theorem, the effective lagrangian is also used to obtain the\ntransition amplitude. For the $1P$ scalars, $D_0^*(2400)^{0}$ and $\nD_0^*(2400)^+$, our estimations of their widths are 226 MeV and 246 MeV,\nrespectively. For $D_J^*(3000)^0$ and $D_J^*(3000)^+$ as the $0^+(2P)$ states,\nwe find their widths are both about 131 MeV, which is a little higher but close\nto the present experimental data, so $D_J^*(3000)$ is still a strong candidate\nof the $2^3P_0$ state.",

    "summary": "Here we concisely review the nonminimal coupling dynamics of a single scalar\nfield in the context of purely affine gravity and extend the study to\nmultifield dynamics. The coupling is performed via an affine connection and its\nassociated curvature without referring to any metric tensor. The latter arises\na posteriori and it may gain an emergent character like the scale of gravity.\nWhat is remarkable in affine gravity is the transition from nonminimal to\nminimal couplings which is realized by only field redefinition of the scalar\nfields. Consequently, the inflationary models gain a unique description in this\ncontext where the observed parameters, like the scalar tilt and the\ntensor-to-scalar ratio, are invariant under field reparametrization. Overall,\ngravity in its affine approach is expected to reveal interesting and rich\nphenomenology in cosmology and astroparticle physics.",

    "summary": "The one-loop contributions to the decays of the CP-odd and CP-even scalar\nbosons $A\\to Z\\gamma\\gamma$ and $\\phi\\to Z\\gamma\\gamma$ ($\\phi=h,H$) are\ncalculated within the framework of CP-conserving THDMs, where they are induced\nby box and reducible Feynman diagrams. The behavior of the corresponding\nbranching ratios are then analyzed within the type-II THDM in a region of the\nparameter space around the alignment limit and still consistent with\nexperimental data. It is found that the $A\\to Z\\gamma\\gamma$ branching ratio is\nonly relevant when $m_A>m_H+m_Z$, but it is negligible otherwise. For $m_A>600$\nGeV and $t_\\beta\\simeq O(1)$, $BR(A\\to Z\\gamma\\gamma)$ can reach values of the\norder of $10^{-5}$, but it decreases by about one order of magnitude as\n$t_\\beta$ increases up to 10. A similar behavior is followed by the $H\\to\nZ\\gamma\\gamma$ decay, which only has a non-negligible branching ratio when\n$m_H>m_A+m_Z$ and can reach the level of $10^{-4}$ for $m_H>600$ GeV and\n$t_\\beta\\simeq O(1)$. Since the properties of the $h$ scalar boson are nearly\nidentical to the SM Higgs boson, the $h\\to Z\\gamma\\gamma$ branching ratio does\nnot deviates significantly from the SM prediction, where it is negligibly\nsmall, of the order of $10^{-9}$.

Heavy Z$'$ gauge\nbosons with lepton-flavor violating transitions are excluded for masses up to\n4.4 TeV. The e$\\mu$ mass spectrum is also interpreted in terms of non-resonant\ncontributions from quantum black-hole production in models with one to six\nextra spatial dimensions, and lower mass limits are found between 3.6 and 5.6\nTeV.

The authors conclude that the gravitational\neffects cancel out for measurements of the electron anomalous magnetic moment,\nbut for the muon measurements, given that they are performed on highly\nrelativistic muons, the effect is large enough to explain the discrepancy\nbetween measured and theoretical values. In this paper this effect is shown to\nbe too small given experimental resolutions, and has been absorbed into the\nsystematic uncertainties of experiments performed to date.

The\ntemperature-dependent potential energy of the three quark system, taking as the\ninternal energy of the system are obtained from the free energy of the system,\nand the temperature-dependent free energy is derived based on Debye-H\\\"uckel\ntheory. The lattice QCD results of the free energy for heavy three-quark system\nare employed and extended to the light three-quark system. The Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nequation for nucleon is solved with the help of Gaussian expansion method and\nthe dissociation temperature of the nucleon is determined according to the\ntemperature dependence of binding energy and radii. Comparing with the\ndissociation temperature of $J/\\psi$, the dissociation temperature of nucleon\nis higher. So, nucleon is more difficult to melt than Charmonium.",

    "summary": "A global analysis of ATLAS and CMS measurements reveals that, at\nmid-rapidity, the directly-produced $\\chi_{c1}$, $\\chi_{c2}$ and J/$\\psi$\nmesons have differential cross sections of seemingly identical shapes, when\npresented as a function of the mass-rescaled transverse momentum, $p_{\\rm\nT}/M$. This identity of kinematic behaviours among S- and P-wave quarkonia is\ncertainly not a natural expectation of non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD), where each\nquarkonium state is supposed to reflect a specific family of elementary\nproduction processes, of significantly different $p_{\\rm T}$-differential cross\nsections. Remarkably, accurate kinematic cancellations among the variegated\nNRQCD terms (colour singlets and octets) of its factorization expansion can\nlead to a surprisingly good description of the data. This peculiar tuning of\nthe NRQCD mixtures leads to a clear prediction regarding the $\\chi_{c1}$ and\n$\\chi_{c2}$ polarizations, the only observables not yet measured: they should\nbe almost maximally different from one another, and from the J/$\\psi$\npolarization, a striking exception in the global panorama of quarkonium\nproduction. Measurements of the difference between the $\\chi_{c1}$, $\\chi_{c2}$\nand J/$\\psi$ polarizations, complementing the observed identity of momentum\ndependences, represent a decisive probe of NRQCD.",

Their application to mid-rapidity LHC data provides strong\nexperimental evidence supporting the validity of the factorization ansatz, a\ncornerstone of non-relativistic QCD, still lacking theoretical demonstration.\nMoreover, data-driven patterns emerge for the factorizable long-distance\nbound-state formation effects, including a remarkable correlation between the\nS-wave quarkonium cross sections and their binding energies. Assuming that this\nscaling can be extended to the P-wave case, we obtain precise predictions for\nthe not yet measured feed-down fractions, thereby providing a complete picture\nof the charmonium and bottomonium feed-down structure.

In this work,\nwe consider the leptophilic DM scenario where the DM particles interact\nexclusively with the electrons through the axial-vector coupling. We\ninvestigate relevant phenomenology in the Sun, including its capture,\nevaporation and thermalisation, and we calculate the equilibrium distribution\nusing the Monte Carlo methods, rather than adopting a semi-analytic\napproximation. Based on the analysis, we then determine the minimum testable\nmass for which the DM-electron coupling strength can be probed via the neutrino\nobservation. Compared to the case of the DM-nucleon interaction, it turns out\nthat minimum detectable mass of the DM-electron interaction is roughly 1 GeV\nsmaller, and a cross section about two orders of magnitude larger is required\nfor the saturation of the annihilation signal.",

Taking the matter parameter $a \\equiv 2\\sqrt{2} \\\nG^{}_{\\rm F} N^{}_e E$ to be an arbitrary scale-like variable with $N^{}_e$\nbeing the net electron number density and $E$ being the neutrino beam energy,\nwe derive a complete set of differential equations for the effective neutrino\nmixing matrix $V$ and the effective neutrino masses $\\widetilde{m}^{}_i$ (for\n$i = 1, 2, 3$) without any {\\it a priori} phase convention or assumption. In\nthe standard parametrization of $V$ the RGEs for $\\{\\widetilde{\\theta}^{}_{12},\n\\widetilde{\\theta}^{}_{13}, \\widetilde{\\theta}^{}_{23}, \\widetilde{\\delta}\\}$\nin matter are presented. We demonstrate some useful differential invariants\nwhich retain the same form from vacuum to matter, including the well-known\nNaumov and Toshev relations. The RGEs of the partial $\\mu$-$\\tau$ asymmetries,\nthe off-diagonal asymmetries and the sides of unitarity triangles of $V$ are\nalso obtained as a by-product.",

Despite the simplicity of the model\n-- introducing three parameters only -- it provides an extremely rich\nphenomenology allowing to accommodate the relic density for a large range of\ncoupling strengths spanning over six orders of magnitude. This model features\nall 'exceptional' mechanisms for dark matter freeze-out, including the recently\ndiscovered conversion-driven freeze-out mode, with interesting signatures of\nlong-lived colored particles at colliders. We constrain the cosmologically\nallowed parameter space with current experimental limits from direct, indirect\nand collider searches, with special emphasis on light dark matter below the top\nmass. In particular, we explore the interplay between limits from Xenon1T,\nFermi-LAT and AMS-02 as well as limits from stop, monojet and Higgs invisible\ndecay searches at the LHC. We find that several blind spots for light dark\nmatter evade current constraints. The region in parameter space where the relic\ndensity is set by the mechanism of conversion-driven freeze-out can be\nconclusively tested by R-hadron searches at the LHC with 300 fb$^{-1}$.",

The\nsecond process assumes that the boson $\\mathcal{B}$ is emitted from the baryon\npair following the $J/\\psi$ decay and includes for the decays into $\\gamma p\n\\overline{p}$ a final state nucleon-antinucleon interaction based on the Paris\n$N \\overline{N}$ potential. The reproduction of the $p \\overline{p}$\ndistribution in the $J/\\psi \\rightarrow \\omega p \\overline{p}$ decays needs a\nfinal state interaction involving a $N(2050)\\ 3/2^-$ resonance. The photon- and\nmeson-emission rates are reproduced in a semi-quantitative way.",

    "summary": "We consider a model of a unstable state defined by the truncated Breit-Wigner\nenergy density distribution function. An analytical form of the survival\namplitude $a(t)$ of the state considered is found. Our attention is focused on\nthe late time properties of $a(t)$ and on effects generated by the\nnon--exponential behavior of this amplitude in the late time region: In 1957\nKhalfin proved that this amplitude tends to zero as $t$ goes to the infinity\nmore slowly than any exponential function of $t$. This effect can be described\nusing a time-dependent decay rate $\\gamma(t)$ and then the Khalfin result means\nthat this $\\gamma(t)$ is not a constant but at late times it tends to zero as\n$t$ goes to the infinity. It appears that the energy $E(t)$ of the unstable\nstate behaves similarly: It tends to the minimal energy $E_{min}$ of the system\nas $t \\to \\infty$. Within the model considered we find two first leading time\ndependent elements of late time asymptotic expansions of $E(t)$ and $\\gamma\n(t)$. We discuss also possible implications of such a late time asymptotic\nproperties of $E(t)$ and $\\gamma (t)$ and cases where these properties may\nmanifest themselves.",

These\nlattice results have been obtained by using both tree-level Symanzik and the\nstandard Wilson action, in the aim of assessing the possible impact of effects\npresumably resulting from a particular choice for the discretization of the\naction. The main resulting feature is the existence of a negative logaritmic\ndivergence at zero-momentum, which pulls the 3-gluon form factors down at low\nmomenta and, consequently, yields a zero-crossing at a given deep IR momentum.\nThe results can be correctly explained by analyzing the relevant\nDyson-Schwinger equations and appropriate truncation schemes.",

The QCD medium is captured by second\ngeneration anisotropic 24^3xN_t lattices from the FASTSUM collaboration,\nincluding 2+1 flavors of clover discretized quarks with m_pi~380 MeV. Two\nBayesian methods are deployed to reconstruct the spectral functions, the recent\nBR method as well as the Maximum Entropy Method with Fourier basis. We take\nparticular care to disentangle genuine in-medium effects from method artifacts\nwith the help of the reconstructed correlator. Consistent with the direct\ninspection of correlators, we observe no significant in-medium modification for\nJ/Psi and eta_c around the crossover, while the chi_c states on the other hand\nshow clear changes around the transition. At the highest temperature, T=352\nMeV, J/Psi and eta_c also exhibit discernible changes compared to the vacuum.\nFor D mesons around $T_c$, no significant modifications are observed, but we\nfind clear indications that no bound state survives at the highest temperature\nof T=352 MeV. Above T_c we discover a significant difference between D and D*\nmesons, the latter being much more strongly affected by the medium.",

It is my melancholy duty to\nreport that these articles are fundamentally flawed in that they fail to\ncorrectly implement the Einstein equivalence principle of general relativity.\nInsofar as one accepts the underlying logic behind these calculations (and so\nrejects general relativity) the claimed effect due to the Earth's gravity will\nbe swamped by the effect due to Sun (by a factor of fifteen), and by the effect\ndue to the Galaxy (by a factor of two thousand). In contrast, insofar as one\naccepts general relativity, then the claimed effect will be suppressed by an\nextra factor of [(size of laboratory)/(radius of Earth)]^2.

    "summary": "The quest for the elusive dark matter (DM) that permeates the Universe (and\nin general the search for signatures of Physics beyond the Standard Model at\nastronomical scales) provides a unique opportunity and a tough challenge to the\nhigh-energy astrophysics community. In particular, the so-called DM indirect\nsearches - mostly focused on a class of theoretically well-motivated DM\ncandidates such as the weakly-interacting massive particles - are affected by a\ncomplex astrophysical background of cosmic radiation. The understanding and\nmodeling of such background requires a deep comprehension of an intricate\nclassical plasma physics problem, i.e. the interaction between high-energy\ncharged particles, accelerated in peculiar astrophysical environments, and\nmagneto-hydrodynamic turbulence in the interstellar medium of our Galaxy. In\nthis review we highlight several aspects of this exciting interplay between the\nmost recent claims of DM annihilation/decay signatures from the sky and the\nGalactic cosmic-ray research field. Our purpose is to further stimulate the\ndebate about viable astrophysical explanations, discussing possible directions\nthat would help breaking degeneracy patterns in the interpretation of current\ndata. We eventually aim to emphasize how a deep knowledge on the physics of CR\ntransport is therefore required to tackle the DM indirect search program at\npresent and in the forthcoming years.",

While gravity is\ninduced by the vacuum expectation value of the scalar field, nonzero vacuum\nenergy facilitates generation of the metric.

    "summary": "The K$^{-}$ over K$^{+}$ multiplicity ratio is measured in deep-inelastic\nscattering, for the first time for kaons carrying a large fraction $z$ of the\nvirtual-photon energy. The data were obtained by the COMPASS collaboration\nusing a 160 GeV muon beam and an isoscalar $^6$LiD target. The regime of\ndeep-inelastic scattering is ensured by requiring $Q^2>1$ (GeV/$c)^2$ for the\nphoton virtuality and $W>5$ GeV/$c^2$ for the invariant mass of the produced\nhadronic system. Kaons are identified in the momentum range from 12 GeV/$c$ to\n40 GeV/$c$, thereby restricting the range in Bjorken-$x$ to $0.01<x<0.40$. The\n$z$-dependence of the multiplicity ratio is studied for $z>0.75$. For very\nlarge values of $z$, $i.e.$ $z>0.8$, the results contradict expectations\nobtained using the formalism of (next-to-)leading order perturbative quantum\nchromodynamics. This may imply that cross-section factorisation or/and\nuniversality of (kaon) fragmentation functions do not hold. Our studies suggest\nthat within this formalism an additional correction may be required, which\ntakes into account the phase space available for hadronisation.",

    "summary": "Einstein's celebrated theory of gravitation can be presented in three forms:\ngeneral relativity, teleparallel gravity, and the rarely considered before\nsymmetric teleparallel gravity. These formulations differ in the underlying\ngeometric structure and interpretations, but are equivalent in observational\npredictions. The theories truly part when one extends them by e.g. nonminimally\ncoupling a scalar field to the metric tensor degree of freedom. Thus extending\nsymmetric teleparallel gravity, we introduce a new class of theories where a\nscalar field is coupled nonminimally to nonmetricity $Q$, which here encodes\nthe gravitational effects like curvature $R$ in general relativity or torsion\n$T$ in teleparallel gravity. We derive the field equations and point out the\nsimilarities and differences with analogous scalar-curvature and scalar-torsion\ntheories. We show that while scalar-nonmetricity gravity lacks invariance under\nconformal transformations, a suitable extra term can restore this; and also\nestablish that $f(Q)$ gravity forms a particular subclass of\nscalar-nonmetricity theories. We illustrate the theory with an example of flat\nFriedmann-Lema\\^{\\i}tre-Robertson-Walker spacetime.",

The transverse densities\ndescribe the distribution of charge and magnetization at fixed light-front time\nand enable a spatial representation of the baryons as relativistic systems. At\nperipheral distances b~1/M_pi the transverse densities are computed using a new\nmethod that combines chiral effective field theory and dispersion analysis. The\nperipheral isovector densities arise from two-pion exchange, which includes the\nrho-meson resonance through elastic unitarity. The isoscalar densities are\nestimated from vector meson exchange (omega, phi). We find that the \"pion\ncloud\" in the charged Sigma hyperons is comparable to the nucleon, while in the\nXi it is suppressed.

We also show that in five-flavour simulations based\non $t\\bar{t}+$multi-jet merging $b$-jet production is mostly driven by the\nparton shower, while matrix elements play only a marginal role in the\ndescription of $g\\to b\\bar{b}$ splittings. Based on these observations we\nadvocate the use of NLOPS simulations of $pp\\to t\\bar{t}b\\bar{b}$ in the\nfour-flavour scheme, and we present a new POWHEG generator of this kind.\nPredictions and uncertainties for $t\\bar{t}+b$-jet observables at the 13 TeV\nLHC are presented both for the case of stable top quarks and with\nspin-correlated top decays. Besides QCD scale variations we consider also\ntheoretical uncertainties related to the POWHEG matching method and to the\nparton shower modelling, with emphasis on $g\\to b\\bar{b}$ splittings. In\ngeneral, matching and shower uncertainties turn out to be remarkably small.\nThis is confirmed also by a tuned comparison against Sherpa+OpenLoops.",

    "summary": "A new subevent cumulant method was recently developed, which can\nsignificantly reduce the non-flow contributions in long-range correlations for\nsmall systems. In this work, we use both standard and subevent cumulant methods\nto study multi-particle correlations in $p$+Pb collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}} = 5.02$ TeV with a multiphase transport (AMPT) model,\nincluding two- and four-particle cumulants ($c_{2}\\{2\\}$ and $c_{2}\\{4\\}$) and\nsymmetric cumulants (SC(2, 3) and SC(2, 4)). Our numerical results show that\n$v_{2}\\{2\\}$ is consistent with the experimental data, while the magnitude of\n$c_{2}\\{4\\}$ is smaller than the experimental data, which may indicate either\nthe collectivity is underestimated or some dynamical fluctuations are missed in\nthe AMPT model. For the symmetric cumulants, we find that the results from\nstandard cumulant method are consistent with the recent CMS data, but those\nfrom subevent cumulant method show different behaviors. It indicates that the\nmeasurements from the standard cumulant method could be contaminated by some\nnon-flow effects, especially when the number of produced particles is small.\nOur results support the subevent cumulant method to be a better tool to explore\nthe $real$ collectivity in small systems.",

    "summary": "In this paper, we use the two-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model with the\nproper time regularization to study the finite-volume effects of QCD chiral\nphase transition.\n  Within a cubic volume of finite size $L$, we choose the stationary wave\ncondition (SWC) as the real physical spatial boundary conditions of quark\nfields and compare our results with that by means of commonly used\n(anti-)period boundary condition (APBC or PBC). It is found that the results by\nmeans of SWC are obviously different to the results from the APBC or PBC.\nAlthough the three boundary conditions give the same chiral crossover\ntransition curve in the infinite volume limit, the limit size $L_0$ (when\n$L\\geq L_{0}$, the chiral quark condensate $-\\left\\langle { \\bar \\psi \\psi}\n\\right\\rangle_L$ is indistinguishable from that at $L=\\infty$) using SWC is\n$L_0\\approx 500$ fm which is much larger than the results obtained using APBC\nor PBC. More importantly, $L_0\\approx 500$ fm is also much large than the\ntypical size of the quark-gluon plasma produced by the relativistic heavy ion\ncollisions. This means that the finite volume effects play a very important\nrole in Relativistic Heavy Ion Collisions. In addition, we also found that when\n$L\\leq 2$ fm, even at zero temperature the chiral symmetry is effectively\nrestored. Furthermore, to quantitatively reflect the finite volume effects on\nthe QCD chiral phase transition, we introduce a new vacuum susceptibility,\n$\\chi_{1/L}(T)=-\\frac{\\partial \\left\\langle { \\bar \\psi \\psi}\n\\right\\rangle}{\\partial (1/L)}$. With this new vacuum susceptibility, it is\nvery interesting to find $\\chi_{1/L}(T=0)=\\chi_{1/L}(T=1/L)$ for SWC.",

    "summary": "In heavy-ion collisions, the quark-gluon plasma is expected to be produced,\nwhich is an almost perfect liquid that made up the Universe a few microseconds\nafter the Big Bang. In these collisions, jets are also formed from hadronizing\npartons with high transverse momentum, and they traverse the hot and dense\nmedium and interact with it. Their properties can be modified by these\ninteractions, therefore these modifications, if present, can give insight into\nthe properties of the plasma itself. Angular correlation measurements can be\nused to study jets in Pb-Pb collisions in a transverse momentum ($p_{\\rm T}$)\nregime where jets are not easily reconstructable above the fluctuating\nbackground. Small collision systems (e.g., pp or p-Pb) can be used as reference\nfor these measurements; however, these collisions themselves are of interest.\nFor example, particle production mechanisms and conservation laws can be tested\nin these systems. Results from Pb-Pb and pp collisions recorded by the ALICE\ndetector are presented in this paper.",

    "summary": "Various new measurements in charmless $B_{u,d,s}\\to PP$ modes, where $P$ is a\nlow lying pseudoscalar meson, are reported by Belle and LHCb. These include the\nrates of $B^0\\to\\pi^0\\pi^0$, $\\eta\\pi^0$, $B_s\\to\\eta'\\eta'$, $B^0\\to K^+K^-$\nand $B^0_s\\to\\pi^+\\pi^-$ decays. Some of these modes are highly suppressed and\nare among the rarest $B$ decays. Direct CP asymmetries on various modes are\nconstantly updated. It is well known that direct CP asymmetries and rates of\nsuppressed modes are sensitive to final state interaction (FSI). As new\nmeasurements are reported and more data will be collected, it is interesting\nand timely to revisit the rescattering effects in $B_{u,d,s}\\to PP$ states. We\nperform a $\\chi^2$ analysis with all available data on CP-averaged rates and CP\nasymmetries in $\\overline B{}_{u,d,s}\\to PP$ decays. Our numerical results are\ncompared to data and those from factorization approach. The quality of the fit\nis improved significantly from the factorization results in the presence of\nrescattering. The relations on topological amplitudes and rescattering are\nexplored and they help to provide a better understanding of the effects of FSI.\nAs suggested by U(3) symmetry on topological amplitudes and FSI, a vanishing\nexchange rescattering scenario is considered. The exchange, annihilation,\n$u$-penguin, $u$-penguin annihilation and some electroweak penguin amplitudes\nare enhanced significantly via annihilation and total annihilation\nrescatterings. In particular, the $u$-penguin annihilation amplitude is sizably\nenhanced by the tree amplitude via total annihilation rescattering. These\nenhancements affect rates and CP asymmetries. Predictions can be checked in the\nnear future.",

    "summary": "The gravitational acceleration of antimatter, gbar, has yet to be directly\nmeasured; an unexpected outcome of its measurement could change our\nunderstanding of gravity, the universe, and the possibility of a fifth force.\nThree avenues are apparent for such a measurement: antihydrogen, positronium,\nand muonium, the last requiring a precision atom interferometer and novel\nmuonium beam under development. The interferometer and its few-picometer\nalignment and calibration systems appear feasible. With 100 nm grating pitch,\nmeasurements of gbar to 10%, 1%, or better can be envisioned. These could\nconstitute the first gravitational measurements of leptonic matter, of\n2nd-generation matter, and possibly, of antimatter.",

    "summary": "Black holes with masses below approximately $10^{15}$ g are expected to emit\ngamma rays with energies above a few tens of MeV, which can be detected by the\nFermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). Although black holes with these masses cannot\nbe formed as a result of stellar evolution, they may have formed in the early\nUniverse and are therefore called Primordial Black Holes (PBHs). Previous\nsearches for PBHs have focused on either short timescale bursts or the\ncontribution of PBHs to the isotropic gamma-ray emission. We show that, in case\nof individual PBHs, the Fermi LAT is most sensitive to PBHs with temperatures\nabove approximately 16 GeV and masses $6\\times 10^{11}$ g, which it can detect\nout to a distance of about 0.03 pc. These PBHs have a remaining lifetime of\nmonths to years at the start of the Fermi mission. They would appear as\npotentially moving point sources with gamma-ray emission that becomes\nspectrally harder and brighter with time until the PBH completely evaporates.\nIn this paper, we develop a new algorithm to detect the proper motion of a\ngamma-ray point sources, and apply it to 318 unassociated point sources at high\ngalactic latitude in the third Fermi-LAT source catalog (3FGL). None of\nunassociated point sources with spectra consistent with PBH evaporation show\nsignificant proper motion. Using the non-detection of PBH candidates, we derive\na 99\\% confidence limit on PBH evaporation rate in the vicinity of the Earth\n$\\dot{\\rho}_{\\rm PBH} < 7.2 \\times 10^3\\: {\\rm {pc}^{-3} {yr}^{-1}}$. This\nlimit is similar to the limits obtained with ground-based gamma-ray\nobservatories.",

In this framework, neutrinos are Dirac fermions. Including only the\nlowest mass-dimension effective operators, some of the LeNCS couple\npredominantly to neutrinos and may be produced in terrestrial neutrino\nexperiments. We examine several existing constraints from particle physics,\nastrophysics, and cosmology to the existence of a LeNCS carrying $B-L$ charge\nequal to two, and discuss the emission of LeNCS's via \"neutrino beamstrahlung,\"\nwhich occurs every once in a while when neutrinos scatter off of ordinary\nmatter.

The Standard Model is minimally\nextended by two sterile fermions and one inert scalar doublet, both having odd\nparity, while the Standard Model particles have an even parity, imposed by a Z2\nsymmetry. The neutrino Yukawa couplings provide additional sources of CP\nviolation, and thus a possible impact on electric dipole moments of charged\nleptons. This model provides two possible dark matter candidates (one bosonic\nand one fermionic) and our results show that, independently of the ordering of\nthe generated light neutrino spectrum, one can have sizeable electron electron\nelectric dipole moment within ACME sensitivity reach in the case of fermionic\ndark matter candidate.",

By\nassuming $E_6$ unification, the renormalization group equations~(RGE) allow us\nto calculate the electroweak parameters at low energies for most of the chains\nof subgroups in $E_6$. From RGE and unitary conditions, we showed that at low\nenergies there must be a mixing between the gauge boson of the standard model\nhypercharge and the $Z'$. From this, it is possible to delimit the preferred\nregion in the parameter space for a breaking pattern in $E_6$. In general,\nwithout unification, it is not possible to determine this region; however, for\nsome models and under certain assumptions, it is possible to limit the\ncorresponding parameter space. By using the most recent upper limits on the\ncross-section of extra gauge vector bosons $Z'$ decaying into dileptons from\nthe ATLAS data at 13 TeV with accumulated luminosities of 36.1~fb$^{-1}$ and\n13.3~fb$^{-1}$, we report the 95$\\%$ C.L. lower limits on the $Z'$ mass for the\ntypical $E_6$ benchmark models.

The next generation of polarising X-ray telescopes will offer new\ndetection possibilities for ALPs. Here we present techniques and projected\nbounds for searching for ALPs with X-ray polarimetry. We demonstrate that\nupcoming X-ray polarimetry missions have the potential to place world-leading\nbounds on ALPs.",

    "summary": "We provide a complete answer to the following question: what are the flavour\ngroups and representations providing, in the symmetric limit, an approximate\ndescription of lepton masses and mixings? We assume that neutrinos masses are\ndescribed by the Weinberg operator. We show that the pattern of lepton masses\nand mixings only depends on the dimension, type (real, pseudoreal, complex),\nand equivalence of the irreducible components of the flavour representation,\nand we find only six viable cases. In all cases the neutrinos are either\nanarchical or have an inverted hierarchical spectrum. In the context of SU(5)\nunification, only the anarchical option is allowed. Therefore, if the hint of a\nnormal hierarchical spectrum were confirmed, we would conclude (under the above\nassumption) that symmetry breaking effects must play a primary role in the\nunderstanding of neutrino flavour observables. In order to obtain the above\nresults, we develop a simple algorithm to determine the form of the lepton\nmasses and mixings directly from the structure of the decomposition of the\nflavour representation in irreducible components, without the need to specify\nthe form of the lepton mass matrices.",

The decay amplitudes\nare separated into two parts in a gauge invariant manner. The first part comes\nfrom the direct coupling of the Higgs boson to the charm (bottom) quark and the\nother from the $ HZZ^{*} $ or the loop-induced $ HZ\\gamma^{*} $ vertexes in the\nstandard model. While the branching ratios from the direct channel are much\nsmaller than those of the indirect channel, their interference terms give\nnontrivial contributions. We further calculate the QCD radiative corrections to\nboth channels, which reduce the total branching ratios by around 20% for both $\nJ/\\psi $ and $ \\Upsilon(1S) $ production.

    "summary": "At this time, the design of the International Linear Collider (ILC) is\noptimized for e+e- collisions; the photon collider (gamma-gamma and\ngamma-electron) is considered as an option. Unexpected discoveries, such as the\ndiphoton excess F(750 GeV) seen at the LHC, could strongly motivate the\nconstruction of a photon collider. In order to enable the gamma-gamma collision\noption, the ILC design should be compatible with it from the very beginning. In\nthis paper, we discuss the problem of the beam crossing angle. In the ILC\ntechnical design, this angle is 14 mrad, which is just enough to provide enough\nspace for the final quadrupoles and outgoing beams. For gamma-gamma collisions,\nthe crossing angle must be larger because the low-energy electrons that result\nfrom multiple Compton scattering get large disruption angles in collisions with\nthe opposing electron beam and some deflection in the solenoidal detector\nfield. For a 2E=500 GeV collider, the required crossing angle is about 25 mrad.\nIn this paper, we consider the factors that determine the crossing angle as\nwell as its minimum permissible value that does not yet cause a considerable\nreduction of the gamma-gamma luminosity. It is shown that the best solution is\nto increase the laser wavelength from the current 1 \\mum (which is optimal for\n2E=500 GeV) to 2 \\mum as this makes possible achieving high gamma-gamma\nluminosities at a crossing angle of 20 mrad, which is also quite comfortable\nfor e+e- collisions, does not cause any degradation of the e+e- luminosity and\nopens the possibility for a more energetic future collider in the same tunnel\n(e.g., CLIC). Moreover, the 2 \\mum wavelength is optimal for a 2E = 1 TeV\ncollider, e.g., a possible ILC energy upgrade. Please consider this paper an\nappeal to increase the ILC crossing angle from 14 to 20 mrad.",

    "summary": "We study topological defects in the Georgi-Machacek model in a hierarchical\nsymmetry breaking in which extra triplets acquire vacuum expectation values\nbefore the doublet. We find a possibility of topologically stable non-Abelian\ndomain walls and non-Abelian flux tubes (vortices) in this model. In the limit\nof the vanishing $U(1)_{\\rm Y}$ gauge coupling in which the custodial symmetry\nbecomes exact, the presence of a vortex spontaneously breaks the custodial\nsymmetry, giving rise to $S^2$ Nambu-Goldstone (NG) modes localized around the\nvortex corresponding to non-Abelian fluxes. Vortices are continuously\ndegenerated by these degrees of freedom, thereby called non-Abelian. By taking\ninto account the $U(1)_{\\rm Y}$ gauge coupling, the custodial symmetry is\nexplicitly broken, the NG modes are lifted, and all non-Abelian vortices fall\ninto a topologically stable $Z$-string. This is in contrast to the SM in which\n$Z$-strings are non-topological and are unstable in the realistic parameter\nregion.Non-Abelian domain walls also break the custodial symmetry and are\naccompanied by localized $S^2$ NG modes. Finally, we discuss the existence of\ndomain wall solutions bounded by flux tubes, where their $S^2$ NG modes match.\nThe domain walls may quantum mechanically decay by creating a hole bounded by a\nflux tube loop, and would be cosmologically safe. Gravitational waves produced\nfrom unstable domain walls could be detected by future experiments",

The whole approach\nis inspired by a class of exotic smoothness structure on\n$S^{3}\\times\\mathbb{R}$. In particular, this class of smoothness structures\ninduces two topological transitions. Then, we are able to calculate the energy\nscales as associated to these topological transitions. For the first transition\nwe will get the value of the GUT scale and the energy of the second transition\nis at the electroweak scale. The topology of of the exotic\n$S^{3}\\times\\mathbb{R}$ determines both, the energy of the scales by certain\ntopological invariants, and the existence of the right-handed sterile neutrino.\nIt is the input for the seesaw mechanism. Secondly, based on this model, we are\nable to calculate the Higgs and neutrino masses which are in a very good\nagreement with experiments. Finally, we give certain hints, again based on\ntopology, why there are three generations of neutrinos and an asymmetry between\nneutrinos and anti-neutrinos.

    "summary": "We present an estimate of the next-to-leading order QCD corrections to mixed\nQCD-electroweak contribution to Higgs boson production cross section in gluon\nfusion, combining the recently computed three-loop virtual corrections and the\napproximate treatment of real emission in the soft approximation. We find that\nthe NLO QCD corrections to mixed QCD-electroweak contributions are nearly\nidentical to NLO QCD corrections to QCD Higgs production. Our result confirms\nan earlier estimate of these ${\\cal O}\\left( \\alpha\\, \\alpha_s^2 \\right)$\neffects in arXiv:0811.3458 [hep-ph] and provides further support for the\nfactorization approximation of QCD and electroweak corrections.",

    "summary": "The magnetic moment of free fermions in the curved spacetime has been studied\nbased on the general relativity. Adopting the Schwarzschild metric for the\nbackground spacetime, the effective value of the magnetic moment has been\ncalculated up to the post-Newtonian order $O(1/c^2)$ for three cases (A) Dirac\nparticles with g=2, (B) neutral fermions with g$\\ne$2 and e=0 and (C) charged\nfermions with g$\\ne$2 and e$\\ne$0. The result shows their gravity dependence is\ngiven as $\\mu_{\\rm m}^{\\rm eff}= (1\\!+\\!3\\phi/c^2) \\,\\mu_{\\rm m} $ for all of\nthese cases in which the coupling between fermions and the electromagnetic\nfield is essentially different. It implies that the magnetic moment is\ninfluenced by the spacetime curvature on the basis of the general relativity\ncommonly for point-like fermions, composite fermions and spread fermions\ndressed with the vacuum fluctuation. The gravitational effect affects the\ngyro-magnetic ratio and the anomalous magnetic moment as ${\\rm g}^{\\rm eff}\n\\!\\simeq\\! (1 \\!+\\! 3\\phi/c^2)\\,{\\rm g} $, ${a}^{\\rm eff} \\!\\simeq\\! a \\!+\\!\n3(1\\!+\\!a)\\,\\phi/c^2 $.

    "summary": "The LHCb has reported the observation of a resonancelike structure, the\nPc(4450), in the J/psi p invariant masses. In our work, we discuss the\nfeasibility of detecting this structure in J/psi photoproduction, e.g. in the\nmeasurements that have been approved for the experiments in Hall A/C and in\nHall B with CLAS12 at JLab. Also the GlueX Collaboration has already reported\npreliminary results. We take into account the experimental resolution effects,\nand perform a global fit to world J/psi photoproduction data in order to study\nthe possibility of observing the Pc(4450) signal in future JLab data. We\npresent a first estimate of the upper limit for the branching ratio of the\nPc(4450) into the J/psi p channel, and we study the angular distributions of\nthe differential cross sections. This will shed light on the nature and\ncouplings of the Pc(4450) structure in the future photoproduction experiments.",

    "summary": "Primordial non-gaussianity (PNG) is an invaluable window into the physical\nprocesses that gave rise to cosmological structure. The presence of local shape\nPNG imprints a distinct scale-dependent correction to the bias of dark matter\ntracers on large scales, which can be effectively probed via the technique of\nintensity mapping. Considering an upcoming generation of experiments, we\ndemonstrate that intensity mapping of CO and [CII] emission can improve upon\nthe current best constraints from the Planck satellite. We show that\nmeasurement of the CO intensity power spectrum by a hypothetical next stage of\nthe ground-based COMAP experiment can achieve $\\sigma(f_{\\rm NL}^{\\rm loc}) =\n3.7$, and that the proposed CMB satellite mission PIXIE can achieve\n$\\sigma(f_{\\rm NL}^{\\rm loc}) = 4.9$ via measurement of [CII] intensity power\nspectrum.",

    "summary": "Prior studies of non-equilibrium dynamics using anisotropic hydrodynamics\nhave used the relativistic Anderson-Witting scattering kernel or some variant\nthereof. In this paper, we make the first study of the impact of using a more\nrealistic scattering kernel. For this purpose, we consider a conformal system\nundergoing transversally-homogenous and boost-invariant Bjorken expansion and\ntake the collisional kernel to be given by the leading order $2 \\leftrightarrow\n2$ scattering kernel in scalar $\\lambda \\phi^4$. We consider both classical and\nquantum statistics in order to assess the impact of Bose enhancement on the\ndynamics. We also determine the anisotropic non-equilibrium attractor of a\nsystem subject to this collisional kernel. We find that, when the\nnear-equilibrium relaxation-times in the Anderson-Witting and scalar\ncollisional kernels are matched, the scalar kernel results in a higher degree\nof momentum-space anisotropy during the system's evolution, given the same\ninitial conditions. Additionally, we find that taking into account Bose\nenhancement further increases the dynamically generated momentum-space\nanisotropy.",

A systematic method is introduced to compute the\nprobability density functions for the CP-violating rephasing invariants of the\nPMNS matrix from the Haar measure relevant to the anarchy principle.

    "summary": "For certain classes of Beyond the Standard Model theories, including\ncomposite Higgs models, the coupling of the Higgs to gauge bosons can be\ndifferent from the Standard Model one. In this case, the multi-boson production\nvia vector boson fusion (VBF) can be hugely enhanced in comparison to the SM\nproduction one due to the lack of cancellation in longitudinal vector boson\nscattering. Among these processes, triple Higgs boson production in VBF plays a\nspecial role - its enhancement is especially spectacular due to the absence of\nbackground from transversely polarised vector bosons in the final state. While\nthe rates from $pp\\to jjhhh$ production in vector boson fusion are too low at\nthe LHC and even at future 33 TeV $pp$ colliders, we have found that the 100\nTeV $pp$ future circular collider (FCC) has the unique opportunity to probe the\n$hVV$ coupling far beyond the LHC sensitivity. We have evaluated the $pp\\to\njjhhh$ rates as a function of deviation from the $hVV$ coupling and have found\nthat the background is much smaller than the signal for observable signal\nrates. We also found that the 100 TeV $pp$ FCC can probe the $hVV$ coupling up\nto the permille level, which is far beyond the LHC reach. These results\nhighlight a special role of the $hhh$ VBF production and stress once more the\nimportance of the 100 TeV $pp$ FCC.",

    "summary": "A persistent challenge in practical classification tasks is that labelled\ntraining sets are not always available. In particle physics, this challenge is\nsurmounted by the use of simulations. These simulations accurately reproduce\nmost features of data, but cannot be trusted to capture all of the complex\ncorrelations exploitable by modern machine learning methods. Recent work in\nweakly supervised learning has shown that simple, low-dimensional classifiers\ncan be trained using only the impure mixtures present in data. Here, we\ndemonstrate that complex, high-dimensional classifiers can also be trained on\nimpure mixtures using weak supervision techniques, with performance comparable\nto what could be achieved with pure samples. Using weak supervision will\ntherefore allow us to avoid relying exclusively on simulations for\nhigh-dimensional classification.

    "summary": "Direct-detection experiments sensitive to low-energy electron recoils from\nsub-GeV dark matter (DM) interactions will also be sensitive to solar neutrinos\nvia coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering (CNS), since the recoiling nucleus can\nproduce a small ionization signal. Solar neutrinos constitute both an\ninteresting signal in their own right and a potential background to a DM search\nthat cannot be controlled or reduced by improved shielding, material\npurification and handling, or improved detector design. We explore these two\npossibilities in detail for semiconductor (Si and Ge) and Xe targets,\nconsidering several possibilities for the unmeasured ionization efficiency at\nlow energies. For DM-electron-scattering searches, neutrinos start being an\nimportant background for exposures larger than ~1-10 kg-years in Si and Ge, and\nfor exposures larger than ~0.1-1 kg-year in Xe. For the absorption of bosonic\nDM (dark photons and axion-like particles) by electrons, neutrinos are most\nrelevant for masses below ~1 keV and again slightly more important in Xe.\nTreating the neutrinos as a signal, we find that the CNS of B-8 neutrinos can\nbe observed with ~2 sigma significance with exposures of ~2, 7, and 20 kg-years\nin Xe, Ge, and Si, respectively, assuming there are no other backgrounds. We\ngive an example for how this would constrain non-standard neutrino\ninteractions. Neutrino components at lower energy can only be detected if the\nionization efficiency is sufficiently large. In this case, observing pep\nneutrinos via CNS requires exposures ~10-100 kg-years in Si or Ge (~1000\nkg-years in Xe), and observing CNO neutrinos would require an order of\nmagnitude more exposure. Only Si could potentially detect Be-7 neutrinos. These\nmeasurements would allow for a direct measurement of the electron-neutrino\nsurvival probability over a wide energy range.",

    "summary": "We calculate the next-to-leading order (NLO) radiative correction to the\ncolor-octet $h_c$ inclusive production in $e^+e^-$ annihilation at Super $B$\nfactory, within the nonrelativistic QCD (NRQCD) factorization scheme. The\nanalytical expression for the NLO short-distance coefficient accompanying the\ncolor-octet production operator $\\mathcal{O}_8^{h_c}(^1S_0)$ is obtained after\nincluding both virtual and real corrections. The NLO correction from the\ncolor-octet channel is found to be positive and substantial. The $h_c$ energy\nspectrum from our NLO prediction is plagued with the end-point divergence, thus\nunphysical. With the aid of the soft-collinear effective theory (SCET), those\nlarge threshold logarithms are resummed to the next-to-leading logarithmic\n(NLL) accuracy. Consequently, we obtain the well-behaved predictions for the\n$h_c$ energy spectrum in the whole kinematic range, which awaits the\nexamination in the forthcoming \\textsf{Belle 2} experiment.",

    "summary": "We perform an analysis of QCD lattice data on charmed meson masses. The\nquark-mass dependence of the data set is used to gain information on the size\nof counter terms of the chiral Lagrangian formulated with open-charm states\nwith J^P= 0^- and J^P =1^- quantum numbers. Of particular interest are those\ncounter terms that are active in the exotic flavour sextet channel. A chiral\nexpansion scheme where physical masses enter the extrapolation formulae is\ndeveloped and applied to the lattice data set. Good convergence properties are\ndemonstrated and an accurate reproduction of the lattice data based on\nensembles of PACS-CS, MILC, HPQCD, ETMC and HSC with pion and kaon masses\nsmaller than 600 MeV is achieved. It is argued that a unique set of low-energy\nparameters is obtainable only if additional information from HSC on some\nscattering observables is included in our global fits. The elastic and\ninelastic s-wave pi D and eta D scattering as considered by HSC is reproduced\nfaithfully. Based on such low-energy parameters we predict 15 phase shifts and\nin-elasticities at physical quark masses but also for an additional HSC\nensemble at smaller pion mass. In addition we find a clear signal for a member\nof the exotic flavour sextet states in the eta D channel, below the bar K D_s\nthreshold. For the isospin violating strong decay width of the D_{s0}(2317) we\nobtain the range (45-49) keV.",

Assuming a minimal extension\nof the scalar sector by a real singlet field, we show that the resulting model\nachieves the same attractive properties as the non-conformal theory, combining\nthe seesaw mechanism and higher-order mass production to generate naturally\nlight neutrino masses. Starting with dimensionless couplings only, all masses\nand energy scales in the theory (including the heavy Majorana masses and the\nelectroweak scale) are obtained from dimensional transmutation via the\nColeman-Weinberg mechanism. A characteristic feature of the conformal model is\nthe appearance of the scalon in the scalar spectrum.The mass of this particle,\nwhich can be expressed in terms of the masses of the other particles in the\ntheory, is produced at the one-loop level. We establish a connection between\nthe large seesaw scale and a suppression of the scalon interactions.

    "summary": "We analyze the scalar potential of the Simplest Little Higgs (SLH) model in\nan approach consistent with the spirit of continuum effective field theory\n(CEFT). By requiring correct electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) with the\n$125\\,\\text{GeV}$ Higgs boson, we are able to derive a relation between the\npseudo-axion mass $m_\\eta$ and the heavy top mass $m_T$, which serves as a\ncrucial test of the SLH mechanism. By requiring $m_\\eta^2>0$ an upper bound on\n$m_T$ can be obtained for any fixed SLH global symmetry breaking scale $f$. We\nalso point out that an absolute upper bound on $f$ can be obtained by imposing\npartial wave unitarity constraint, which in turn leads to absolute upper bounds\nof $m_T\\lesssim 19\\,\\text{TeV}, m_\\eta\\lesssim 1.5\\,\\text{TeV}$ and\n$m_{Z'}\\lesssim 48\\,\\text{TeV}$. We present the allowed region in the\nthree-dimensional parameter space characterized by $f,t_\\beta,m_T$, taking into\naccount the requirement of valid EWSB and the constraint from perturbative\nunitarity. We also propose a strategy of analyzing the fine-tuning problem\nconsistent with the spirit of CEFT and apply it to the SLH. We suggest that the\nscalar potential and fine-tuning analysis strategies adopted here should also\nbe applicable to a wide class of Little Higgs and Twin Higgs models, which may\nreveal interesting relations as crucial tests of the related EWSB mechanism and\nprovide a new perspective on assessing their degree of fine-tuning.",

    "summary": "The asymmetry between matter and antimatter is key to the existence and\nnature of our Universe. A measure of the matter - antimatter asymmetry of the\nUniverse is provided by the present value of the universal ratio of baryons\n(baryons minus antibaryons) to photons (or the ratio of baryons to entropy).\nThe baryon asymmetry parameter is an important physical and cosmological\nparameter. But how fine tuned is it? A \"natural\" value for this parameter is\nzero, corresponding to equal amounts of matter and antimatter. Another, also\npossibly natural, choice for this dimensionless parameter would be of order\nunity, corresponding to nearly equal amounts (by number) of matter (and\nessentially no antimatter) and photons in every comoving volume. However,\nobservations suggest that in the Universe we inhabit the value of this\nparameter is nonzero, but smaller than this natural value by some nine to ten\norders of magnitude. In this contribution we review the evidence that our\nUniverse does not contain equal amounts of matter and antimatter. Any change in\nthe magnitude of the baryon asymmetry parameter necessarily leads to a universe\nwith physical characteristics different from those in our own. The degree of\nfine tuning in the baryon asymmetry parameter is determined by the width of the\nrange over which it can be varied and still allow for the existence of life.\nOur results suggest that the baryon asymmetry parameter can be varied over a\nvery wide range without impacting the prospects for life; this result is not\nsuggestive of fine tuning.

    "summary": "Stop coannihilation may bring the relic density of heavy supersymmetric dark\nmatter particles into the range allowed by cosmology. The efficiency of this\nprocess is enhanced by stop-antistop annihilations into the longitudinal\n(Goldstone) modes of the $W$ and $Z$ bosons, as well as by Sommerfeld\nenhancement of stop annihilations and the effects of bound states. Since the\ncouplings of the stops to the Goldstone modes are proportional to the trilinear\nsoft supersymmetry-breaking $A$-terms, these annihilations are enhanced when\nthe $A$-terms are large. However, the Higgs mass may be reduced below the\nmeasured value if the $A$-terms are too large. Unfortunately, the\ninterpretation of this constraint on the stop coannihilation strip is clouded\nby differences between the available Higgs mass calculators. For our study, we\nuse as our default calculator FeynHiggs 2.13.0, the most recent publicly\navailable version of this code. Exploring the CMSSM parameter space, we find\nthat along the stop coannihilation strip the masses of the stops are severely\nsplit by the large $A$-terms. This suppresses the Higgs mass drastically for\n$\\mu$ and $A_0 > 0$, whilst the extent of the stop coannihilation strip is\nlimited for $A_0 < 0$ and either sign of $\\mu$. However, in sub-GUT models,\nreduced renormalization-group running mitigates the effect of the large\n$A$-terms, allowing larger LSP masses to be consistent with the Higgs mass\ncalculation. We give examples where the dark matter particle mass may reach\n$\\gtrsim 8$ TeV.",

In an\neffective theory approach, we study the lowest dimension interacting terms of\ndark matter with standard model fields, assuming that dark matter fields\ntransform as singlets under the standard model gauge group. There are three\ndimension-four operators, two of them yielding a Higgs portal to dark matter.\nThe third operator couple the photon and $Z^0$ fields to the higher multipoles\nof dark matter, yielding a \\textit{spin portal} to dark matter. For dark matter\n($D$) mass below a half of the $Z^0$ mass, the decays $Z^0\\to \\bar{D} D$ and\n$H\\to \\bar{D}D$ are kinematically allowed and contribute to the invisible\nwidths of the $Z^0$ and $H$. We calculate these decays and use experimental\nresults on these invisible widths to constrain the values of the low energy\nconstants finding in general that effects of the spin portal can be more\nimportant that those of the Higgs portal. We calculate the dark matter relic\ndensity in our formalism, use the constraints on the low energy constants from\nthe $Z^0$ and $H$ invisible widths and compare our results with the measured\nrelic density, finding that dark matter with a $(1,0)\\oplus(0,1)$ space-time\nstructure must have a mass $M>43 ~ GeV$.",

    "summary": "Studies of the nucleon resonance electroexcitation amplitudes in a wide range\nof photon virtualities offer unique information on many facets of strong QCD\nbehind the generation of all prominent excited nucleon states. Advances in the\nevaluation of resonance electroexcitation amplitudes from the data measured\nwith the CLAS detector and the future extension of these studies with the\nCLAS12 detector at Jefferson Lab are presented. For the first time, analyses of\n$\\pi^0p$, $\\pi^+n$, $\\eta p$, and $\\pi^+\\pi^-p$ electroproduction off proton\nchannels have provided electroexcitation amplitudes of most resonances in the\nmass range up to 1.8 GeV and at photon virtualities $Q^2 < 5$~GeV$^2$.Studies\nof the resonance electroexcitation amplitudes revealed the $N^*$ structure as a\ncomplex interplay between the inner core of three dressed quarks and the\nexternal meson-baryon cloud.

Future experiments with the CLAS12 detector\nwill offer insight into the structure of all prominent resonances at the\nhighest photon virtualities, $Q^2 < 12$~GeV$^2$, ever achieved in exclusive\nreactions, thus addressing the most challenging problems of the Standard Model\non the nature of hadron mass, quark-gluon confinement, and the emergence of\nnucleon resonance structures from QCD.

    "summary": "Anomaly-mediated supersymmetry breaking (AMSB) models seem to have become\nincreasingly implausible due to 1. difficulty in generating a Higgs mass\nm(h)~125 GeV, 2. typically unnatural superparticle spectra characterized by a\nlarge superpotential mu term and 3. the possibility of a wino-like lightest\nSUSY particle (LSP) as dark matter now seems to be excluded. In the present\npaper we propose some minor modifications to the paradigm model which solve\nthese three issues. Instead of adding a universal bulk scalar mass to avoid\ntachyonic sleptons, we add distinct Higgs and matter scalar soft masses which\nthen allow for light higgsinos. To gain accord with the measured Higgs mass, we\nalso include a bulk trilinear soft term. The ensuing natural generalized AMSB\n(nAMSB) model then has a set of light higgsinos with mass nearby the weak scale\nm(W,Z,h)~100 GeV as required by naturalness while the winos populate the\nseveral hundred GeV range and gluinos and squarks occupy the multi-TeV range.\nFor LHC searches, the wino pair production followed by decay to same-sign\ndiboson signature channel offers excellent prospects for discovery at high\nluminosity LHC along with higgsino pair production leading to soft dileptons\nplus jet(s)+MET. A linear e^+e^- collider operating above higgsino pair\nproduction threshold should be able to distinguish the AMSB gaugino spectra\nfrom unified or mirage unified scenarios. Dark matter is expected to occur as a\nhiggsino-like WIMP plus axion admixture.",

    "summary": "Given the high luminosities at which CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC)\noperates, multiple proton-proton collisions occur during the same bunch\ncrossing. Hard collisions are therefore contaminated by several soft,\nzero-bias, ones. This effect, known as pileup pollutes the reconstruction of\nthe final state of the collision.\n  This document is meant to provide a theoretical review of the methods\nemployed during Run I of the LHC and at the beginning of Run II to mitigate\npileup effects. I will start with a in-depth presentation of the area-median\nused for the vast majority of applications, including several refinements of\nthe original idea, their practical (numerical) implementation and an assessment\nof their efficiency and robustness. I will then focus on several theoretical\ncalculations that can provide both quantitative and qualitative information on\nthe area-median approach.\n  In the specific case of boosted jets, a field that has seen a wide interest\nrecently, a set of methods, known as grooming techniques has also been used. I\nwill describe these techniques, address their performance and briefly show that\nthey are amenable to a theoretical, analytic, understanding.\n  The last part of this review will focus on ideas oriented towards future\npileup mitigation techniques. This includes a couple of new methods that have\nrecently been proposed as well as a large series of alternative methods. The\nlatter are yet unpublished and have not received the same amount of\ninvestigation than the former but they have the potential to bring new\ndevelopments and further improvement over existing techniques in a future where\npileup mitigation will be crucial.",

This Poincar\\'e-covariant analysis predicts that such baryons have a\ncomplicated angular momentum structure. For instance, the ground states are all\nprimarily $S$-wave in character, but each possesses $P$-, $D$- and $F$-wave\ncomponents, with the $P$-wave fraction being large in the $qqq$ states; and the\nfirst positive-parity excitation in each channel has a large $D$-wave\ncomponent, which grows with increasing current-quark mass, but also exhibits\nfeatures consistent with a radial excitation. The configuration space extent of\nall such baryons decreases as the mass of the valence-quark constituents\nincreases.",

    "summary": "The $D$ and $B$ meson semileptonic decays with pion or light hadron in the\nfinal state is a $c\\bar{d} \\to \\pi \\ell \\nu $ and $b \\bar{d}\\to \\pi \\ell\\nu $\nannihilation process, similar to the two-photon and two-gluon decays of the\n$P$-wave $\\chi_{c0,2}$ and $\\chi_{b0,2}$ charmonium state. From the\nannihilation Born term, we obtain a very simple expression for the form\nfactors, given as~: $ f_{+}(0)/(1 -q^{2}/(m_{H}^{2}+ m_{\\pi}^{2}))$, with\n$H=D,B$ for $D,B \\to \\pi$ form factors, and $f_{+}(0)/(1 -q^{2}/(m_{H}^{2}+\nm_{K}^{2}))$ for $B,D\\to K$ form factor. This expression for the form factors\nis found to describe rather well the $q^{2}$- behaviour observed in the BaBar,\nBelle and BESSIII measurements and lattice simulation. In particular, the $D\\to\nK$ form factor is in good agreement with the measured values in the whole range\nof $q^{2}$ showing evidence for $SU(3)$ breaking with the presence of\n$m_{K}^{2}$ term in the quark propagator, but some corrections to the Born term\nare needed at large $q^{2}$ for $D,B \\to \\pi$ form factors. The\n$q^{2}$-behaviour we obtain shows that without the Born term, it would be quite\ndifficult to obtain otherwise this $q^{2}$-dependence for the heavy-light form\nfactors in $D$ and $B$ semileptonic decays.",

    "summary": "Upon the absence of signals of new physics at the LHC, a reasonable strategy\nof a new physics model is to assume that new particles are very heavy beyond\nthe LHC reach and the model parameters are unknown yet. In the aligned two\nHiggs doublet model, however, heavy Higgs boson masses above 500 GeV enhance\nsome couplings in the scalar potential, which causes a breakdown of the\nperturbative unitariry in general. Some tuning among model parameters is\nrequired. We find that one information on the heavy Higgs boson mass, say\n$M_H$, has significant and interesting implications: (i) the other heavy Higgs\nbosons should have similar masses to $M_H$ within $\\pm \\mathcal{O}(10)\\%$; (ii)\nthe inequalities from the theoretical constraints are practically reduced to an\nequation such that $m_{12}^2 \\tan\\beta$ is constant, where $m_{12}^2$ is the\nsoft $Z_2$ breaking parameter and $\\tan\\beta$ is the ratio of two vacuum\nexpectation values; (iii) the triple Higgs coupling $\\lambda_{HHh}$ is constant\nover $\\tan\\beta$ while $\\lambda_{HHH}$ and $\\lambda_{AAH}$ are linearly\nproportional to $\\tan\\beta$. The double Higgs-strahlung process of $e^+ e^- \\to\nZHH$ is also studied, of which the total cross section is almost constant with\nthe given $M_H$.",

    "summary": "We outline a kinetic theory of non-thermal fixed points for the example of a\ndilute Bose gas, partially reviewing results obtained earlier, thereby\nextending, complementing, generalizing and straightening them out. We study\nuniversal dynamics after a cooling quench, focusing on situations where the\ntime evolution represents a pure rescaling of spatial correlations, with time\ndefining the scale parameter. The non-equilibrium initial condition set by the\nquench induces a redistribution of particles in momentum space. Depending on\nconservation laws, this can take the form of a wave-turbulent flux or of a more\ngeneral self-similar evolution, signaling the critically slowed approach to a\nnon-thermal fixed point. We identify such fixed points using a non-perturbative\nkinetic theory of collective scattering between highly occupied long-wavelength\nmodes. In contrast, a wave-turbulent flux, possible in the perturbative\nBoltzmann regime, builds up in a critically accelerated self-similar manner. A\nkey result is the simple analytical universal scaling form of the\nnon-perturbative many-body scattering matrix, for which we lay out the concrete\nconditions under which it applies. We derive the scaling exponents for the time\nevolution as well as for the power-law tail of the momentum distribution\nfunction, for a general dynamical critical exponent $z$ and an anomalous\nscaling dimension $\\eta$. The approach of the non-thermal fixed point is, in\nparticular, found to involve a rescaling of momenta in time $t$ by $t^{\\beta}$,\nwith $\\beta=1/z$, within our kinetic approach independent of $\\eta$. We confirm\nour analytical predictions by numerically evaluating the kinetic scattering\nintegral as well as the non-perturbative many-body coupling function. As a side\nresult we obtain a possible finite-size interpretation of wave-turbulent\nscaling recently measured by Navon et al.",

The paper draws attention to the reactions $pp\\to\np(f_1(1285)/f_1(1420))p\\to$ $\\to p(\\pi^+\\pi^-\\pi^0)p$ and $pp\\to p(K\\bar K)p\\to\np(a^0_0(980))p \\to p(\\eta\\pi^0)p$ in which a similar situation can be realized\nowing to the $K\\bar K$ loop mechanisms of the breaking of isotopic symmetry. We\nnote that there is no any visible background in the $\\pi^+\\pi^-\\pi^0$ and $\\eta\n\\pi^0$ channels. Observation of the process $pp\\to p(f_1(1285))p\\to\np(\\pi^+\\pi^-\\pi^0)p$ would be a confirmation of the first results from the VES\nand BESIII detectors indicating the very large isospin breaking in the decay\n$f_1(1285))\\to\\pi^+\\pi^-\\pi^0$.",

    "summary": "Within the mirror dark matter model and dissipative dark matter models in\ngeneral, halos around galaxies with active star formation (including spirals\nand gas rich dwarfs) can be modelled as a fluid, which expands and contracts in\nresponse to heating and cooling processes. Ordinary Type II supernovae (SN) can\nprovide the dominant heat source, possible if kinetic mixing interaction exists\nwith strength $\\epsilon \\sim 10^{-9} - 10^{-10}$. The dark fluid around\nsufficiently isolated and unperturbed galaxies can potentially relax to a\nsteady state configuration, where heating and cooling rates locally balance and\nhydrostatic equilibrium prevails. These steady state conditions can be solved\nto derive the physical properties, including the halo density and temperature\nprofiles, for model galaxies. We have considered idealized spherically\nsymmetric galaxies within the mirror dark particle model, as in the earlier\npaper [paper I, arXiv:1707.02528], but we have assumed that the local halo\nheating in the SN vicinity dominates over radiative sources. With this\nassumption, physically interesting steady state solutions arise which we\ncompute for a representative range of model galaxies. The end result is a\nrather simple description of the dark matter halo around idealized spherically\nsymmetric systems, characterized in principle by only 1 parameter, with\nphysical properties that closely resemble the empirical properties of disk\ngalaxies.",

The peak structure of $\\kappa \\sigma^2$ along the\nfreeze-out line is solely determined by the existence of the CEP mountain and\ncan be used as a clean signature for the existence of CEP. The formation of the\ndip structure is sensitive to the relation between the freeze-out line and the\nphase boundary. The dip structure can be formed if the freeze-out line starts\nfrom the temperature above the critical temperature at $\\mu=0$ and crosses the\nfoot of the CEP mountain. It is noticed that the extracted freeze-out\ntemperature from beam energy scan measurement at RHIC is indeed higher than the\ncrossover phase boundary, which supports our analysis for the formation of the\ndip structure. Around the CEP for chiral phase transition there is a negative\nregion of $\\kappa \\sigma^2$ from the crossover side, the positive $\\kappa\n\\sigma^2$ at the dip from measurement indicates that the freeze-out line is\naway from the negative region",

    "summary": "We consider a Standard Model extension by a heavy charged scalar gauged only\nunder the $U_{Y}(1)$ weak hypercharge gauge group. Such an extension, being\ngauge invariant with respect to the SM gauge group, is a simple special case of\nthe well known Zee model. Since the interactions of the charged scalar with the\nStandard Model fermions turn out to be significantly suppressed compared to the\nStandard Model interactions, the charged scalar provides an example of a\nlong-lived charged particle being interesting to search for at the LHC. We\npresent the pair and single production cross sections of the charged boson at\ndifferent colliders and the possible decay widths for various boson masses. It\nis shown that the current ATLAS and CMS searches at 13 TeV collision energy\nlead to the bounds on the scalar boson mass of about 400 GeV. The limits are\nexpected to be much larger for higher collision energies and, assuming\n$15~ab^{-1}$ integrated luminosity, reach about 4 TeV at future 27 TeV LHC thus\ncovering the most interesting mass region.",

    "summary": "The present talk consists of two parts. The first one is allocated for\nconsideration of the dimension of bilocal meson fields for quark-antiquark\nmeson systems, which have been so far treated as the bosonic fields independent\nof constituent quark flavors, in the covariant oscillator quark model.\nRevisiting the electromagnetic currents of quark-antiquark meson systems, we\nshow that the bilocal meson fields should be bosonic for light-quark meson\nsystems, while fermionic for heavy-light and heavy-heavy meson systems. In the\nsecond part we apply the effective electromagnetic interactions of meson\nsystems derived in the first part to radiative decay processes for the excited\nstates of light-quark mesons. The calculated results for the $\\pi \\gamma$ decay\nwidths of the $a_1(1260)$, $a_2(1320)$, $b_1(1235)$ and $\\pi_2(1670)$ mesons\nare in fair agreement with experiment, except for the $b_1(1235)$ meson. As for\nthe $\\rho(770)^0 \\gamma$ decay width of the $f_1(1285)$ the present model\nstrongly supports the experimental results in 1995 and 2016, respectively, of\nVES and CLAS Collaborations, not the average value by the Particle Data Group.",

The coupling of the axion to massless gauge fields can\ninduce copious particle production during inflation, resulting in large\nnon-Gaussian curvature perturbation that leads to the formation of primordial\nblack holes. In this paper, we explore the parameter space in the axion\nmonodromy inflation model that favors the formation of primordial black holes\nwith masses ranging from $10^8$ grams to $10$ solar masses.

In the colliding energies of Large\nHadron Collider, charmonium final yields are dominated by the recombination of\ncharm and anti-charm quarks in the deconfined phase. Heavy quark diffusions\ndepend less on the shear viscosity of the bulk medium, which makes the J/psi\nnuclear modification factor in the entire pT bin shows weak dependence on the\nshear viscosity of QGP.

This paper is the first part of a series in which we calculate a\ncomplete set of quark/quark, quark/antiquark, and antiquark/antiquark spatial\ncorrelation functions in heavy-light ion collisions, with the goal of\nincorporating their conserved charges into the initial conditions of\nhydrodynamics. The physical mechanisms captured in this calculation include\ngeometric, entanglement, and interaction-mediated correlations. In this first\npaper, we construct the building blocks for the correlations arising from\nsingle- and double-pair production, studying in detail the single-pair case and\nthe general features of the double-pair case. We find a rich correlation\nstructure in transverse coordinate space, with different mechanisms dominating\nover different length scales, and we present explicit results for the\nquark-antiquark correlations in the single-pair production regime.

    "summary": "A revolution in elementary particle physics occurred during the period from\nthe ICHEP1968 to the ICHEP1982 with the advent of the parton model from\ndiscoveries in Deeply Inelastic electron-proton Scattering at SLAC, neutrino\nexperiments, hard-scattering observed in p$+$p collisions at the CERN ISR, the\ndevelopment of QCD, the discovery of the J/$\\Psi$ at BNL and SLAC and the clear\nobservation of high transverse momentum jets at the CERN SPS $\\bar{p}+p$\ncollider. These and other discoveries in this period led to the acceptance of\nQCD as the theory of the strong interactions. The desire to understand nuclear\nphysics at high density such as in neutron stars led to the application of QCD\nto this problem and to the prediction of a Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) in nuclei\nat high energy density and temperatures. This eventually led to the\nconstruction of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at BNL to observe\nsuperdense nuclear matter in the laboratory. This article discusses how\nexperimental methods and results which confirmed QCD at the first hadron\ncollider, the CERN ISR, played an important role in experiments at the first\nheavy ion collider, RHIC, leading to the discovery of the QGP as a perfect\nliquid as well as discoveries at RHIC and the LHC which continue to the present\nday.",

Previous\nstudies showed that a relatively small detector with ~10 m length and ~1 m\ncross sectional area can probe large unconstrained parts of parameter space for\ndark photons and dark Higgs bosons. In this work we show that FASER will also\nbe sensitive to heavy neutral leptons that have mixing angles with the active\nneutrinos that are up to an order of magnitude lower than current bounds. In\nparticular, this is true for heavy neutral leptons produced dominantly in $B$\nmeson decays, in which case FASER's discovery potential is comparable to the\nproposed SHiP detector. We also illustrate how the search for heavy neutral\nleptons at FASER will be complementary to ongoing searches in high-$p_T$\nexperiments at the LHC and can shed light on the nature of dark matter and the\nprocess of baryogenesis in the early Universe.",

To allow\nLArTPCs to operate in the high-multiplicity near detector environment of DUNE,\na new charge readout technology is required. Traditional charge readout\ntechnologies introduce intrinsic ambiguities, combined with a slow detector\nresponse, these ambiguities have limited the performance of LArTPCs, until now.\nHere, we present a novel pixelated charge readout that enables the full 3D\ntracking capabilities of LArTPCs. We characterise the signal to noise ratio of\ncharge readout chain, to be about 14, and demonstrate track reconstruction on\n3D space points produced by the pixel readout. This pixelated charge readout\nmakes LArTPCs a viable option for the DUNE near detector complex.",

    "summary": "Well-motivated extensions of the standard model predict ultra-light and\nfundamental pseudo-scalar particles (e.g., axions or axion-like particles:\nALPs). Similarly to the Primakoff-effect for axions, ALPs can mix with photons\nand consequently be searched for in laboratory experiments and with\nastrophysical observations. Here, we search for energy-dependent modulations of\nhigh-energy gamma-ray spectra that are tell-tale signatures of photon-ALPs\nmixing. To this end, we analyze the data recorded with the Fermi -LAT from\nGalactic pulsars selected to have a line of sight crossing spiral arms at a\nlarge pitch angle. The large-scale Galactic magnetic field traces the shape of\nspiral arms, such that a sizable photon-ALP conversion probability is expected\nfor the sources considered. In nine years of Fermi -LAT data, we detect\nsignificant spectral features in the selected source-sample consistent with\nphoton-ALPs oscillation with a combined statistical significance of 5.52\n{\\sigma} . Notably, sources with neighboring lines of sight share similar\nspectral features. From a common fit to all sources, we determine the\nmost-likely parameters for mass $m_{a}$ and coupling $g_{a\\gamma\\gamma}$ to be\n$m_a=(3.6 \\substack{+0.5_ \\mathrm{stat.}\\\\-0.2_ \\mathrm{stat.}}\\pm\n0.2_\\mathrm{syst.} )$ neV and $g_{a\\gamma\\gamma}=(2.3\\substack{+0.3_\n\\mathrm{stat.}\\\\-0.4_ \\mathrm{stat.}}\\pm 0.4_\\mathrm{syst.})\\times 10^{-10}$\nGeV$^{-1}$. In the error budget, we consider instrumental effects, scaling of\nthe adopted Galactic magnetic field model ($\\pm~20~\\%$), and uncertainties on\nthe distance of individual sources. We note that an astrophysical\ninterpretation of the detected modulation is not obvious.",

We thus consider a functional\nobtained from the density matrix expansion of local nuclear potentials from\nchiral effective field theory. We propose a parametrization of this functional\ncarefully calibrated and validated on selected ground-state properties that is\nsuitable for large-scale calculations of nuclear properties. The first\ncomponent of this functional is a non-local functional of the density and\ncorresponds to the direct part (Hartree term) of the expectation value of local\nchiral potentials on a Slater determinant. A second component is a local\nfunctional of the density and is obtained by applying the density matrix\nexpansion to the exchange part (Fock term) of the expectation value of the\nlocal chiral potential. We apply the UNEDF2 optimization protocol to determine\nthe coupling constants of this energy functional. We obtain a set of\nmicroscopically-constrained functionals for local chiral potentials from\nleading-order up to next-to-next-to-leading order with and without three-body\nforces and contributions from $\\Delta$ excitations. These functionals are\nvalidated on the calculation of nuclear and neutron matter, nuclear mass\ntables, single-particle shell structure in closed-shell nuclei and the fission\nbarrier of $^{240}$Pu. Quantitatively, they perform noticeable better than the\nmore phenomenological Skyrme functionals. The inclusion of higher-order terms\nin the chiral perturbation expansion seems to produce a systematic improvement\nin predicting nuclear binding energies. This result is especially promising\nsince all the fits have been performed at the single reference level of the\nenergy density functional approach, where important collective correlations\nsuch as center-of-mass correction have not been taken into account yet.",

    "summary": "The measurement of the charge asymmetry $A_{FB}(e^-e^+\\to \\mu^-\\mu^+)$ will\nplay an important role at the high-luminosity circular electron-positron\ncollider FCCee considered for construction at CERN. In particular, near the Z\nresonance, $\\sqrt{s} \\simeq M_Z \\pm 3.5$ GeV, $A_{FB}$ will provide a very\nprecise value of the pure electromagnetic coupling constant\n$\\alpha_{QED}(M_Z)$, which is vitally important for overall tests of the\nStandard Model. For this purpose, $A_{FB}$ will be measured at the FCCee with\nan experimental error better than $\\delta A_{FB} \\simeq 3\\cdot 10^{-5},$ at\nleast a factor 100 more precisely than at past LEP experiments! The important\nquestion is whether the effect of interference between photon emission in the\ninitial and final state can be removed from the $A_{FB}$ data at the same\nprecision level using perturbative QED calculations. A first quantitative study\nof this problem is presented here, with the help of the KKMC program and a\nnewly developed calculation based on soft photon resummation, matched with NLO\nand NNLO fixed-order calculations. It is concluded that a factor of 10\nimprovement with respect to the LEP era is obtained. We also present a clear\nindication that reducing the uncertainty of charge asymmetry near the Z peak\ndue to IFI down to $\\delta A_{FB} \\simeq 3\\cdot 10^{-5}$, i.e. the expected\nexperimental precision at FCCee, is feasible.",

    "summary": "We obtain the first cosmological constraints on interactions between dark\nmatter and protons within the formalism of nonrelativistic effective field\ntheory developed for direct detection. For each interaction operator in the\neffective theory, parameterized by different powers of the relative velocity of\nthe incoming particles, we use the Planck 2015 cosmic microwave background\n(CMB) temperature, polarization, and lensing anisotropy to set upper limits on\nthe scattering cross section for all dark matter masses above 15 keV. We find\nthat for interactions associated with a stronger dependence on velocity, dark\nmatter and baryons stay thermally coupled for longer, but the interaction\nstrengths are suppressed at the low temperatures relevant for Planck\nobservations and are thus less constrained. At the same time, cross sections\nwith stronger velocity dependencies are more constrained in the limit of small\ndark matter mass. In all cases, the effect of dark matter-proton scattering is\nmost prominent on small scales in the CMB power spectra and in the matter power\nspectrum, and we thus expect substantial improvement over the current limits\nwith data from ground-based CMB experiments and galaxy surveys.",

The peculiarities of\nQCD ensure that it is also the only known fundamental theory with the capacity\nto sustain massless elementary degrees-of-freedom, gluons and quarks; and yet\ngluons and quarks are predicted to acquire mass dynamically so that the only\nmassless systems in QCD are its composite Nambu-Goldstone bosons. All other\neveryday bound states possess nuclear-size masses, far in excess of anything\nthat can directly be tied to the Higgs boson. These observations highlight\nfundamental questions within the Standard Model: what is the source of the mass\nfor the vast bulk of visible matter in the Universe, how is its appearance\nconnected with confinement; how is this mass distributed within hadrons and\ndoes the distribution differ from one hadron to another?

    "summary": "WIMP-nucleon scattering is analyzed at order $1/M$ in Heavy WIMP Effective\nTheory. The $1/M$ power corrections, where $M\\gg m_W$ is the WIMP mass,\ndistinguish between different underlying UV models with the same universal\nlimit and their impact on direct detection rates can be enhanced relative to\nnaive expectations due to generic amplitude-level cancellations at leading\norder. The necessary one- and two-loop matching calculations onto the\nlow-energy effective theory for WIMP interactions with Standard Model quarks\nand gluons are performed for the case of an electroweak SU(2) triplet WIMP,\nconsidering both the cases of elementary fermions and composite scalars. The\nlow-velocity WIMP-nucleon scattering cross section is evaluated and compared\nwith current experimental limits and projected future sensitivities. Our\nresults provide the most robust prediction for electroweak triplet Majorana\nfermion dark matter direct detection rates; for this case, a cancellation\nbetween two sources of power corrections yields a small total $1/M$ correction,\nand a total cross section close to the universal limit for $M \\gtrsim {\\rm few}\n\\times 100\\,{\\rm GeV}$. For the SU(2) composite scalar, the $1/M$ corrections\nintroduce dependence on underlying strong dynamics. Using a leading chiral\nlogarithm evaluation, the total $1/M$ correction has a larger magnitude and\nuncertainty than in the fermionic case, with a sign that further suppresses the\ntotal cross section. These examples provide definite targets for future direct\ndetection experiments and motivate large scale detectors capable of probing to\nthe neutrino floor in the TeV mass regime.",

    "summary": "Extra dimensions (ED) can provide a useful tool for model-building. In this\npaper we introduce a single, flat ED extension of the kinetic-mixing/dark\nphoton (DP) portal for dark matter (DM) interactions with the Standard Model\n(SM) assuming a compactification `radius' of order $R^{-1}\\sim10-1000$ MeV and\nexamine the resulting modifications to and augmentation of the usual DP\nphenomenology. In the present scenario, both the DP and DM experience the full\n5-D while the SM fields are constrained to lie on a 4-D brane at the boundary\nof the ED. Such a setup can naturally yield the observed value of the DM relic\ndensity and explain the required rough degeneracy of the DM and DP masses\nneeded to obtain it. Gauge symmetry breaking can occur via boundary conditions\nwithout the introduction of an additional singlet Higgs scalar thus avoiding\nall constraints associated with the coupling of such a field to the usual SM\nHiggs field in 5-D. The self-consistency of the field redefinitions that map\nthe gauge fields into a canonical basis and thus removing the kinetic mixing\nterms is found to lead to a strong model building constraint on the ED setup\ninvolving a brane localized kinetic term for the 5-D gauge field on the SM\nbrane. Multiple variations of this scenario are found to be possible which are\nconsistent with all current experimental constraints but which predict very\ndifferent phenomenologies. In this paper, after setting up the general model\nformalism, we discuss in detail the case of a complex scalar 5-D DM field,\nconsistent with constraints arising from the CMB, which may or may not obtain a\nvacuum expectation value (vev). The resulting Kaluza-Klein (KK) towers of both\nthe DM and DP fields are found to yield interesting and distinctive signatures.",

In particular, using\nBayesian methods, we explore the quantitative distinctions that allow\ndifferentiation between different non-relativistic effective operators, as a\nfunction of the number of detected events, for a variety of possible operators\nthat might generate the detected distribution.

    "summary": "The paper discusses the one-loop (NLO) electroweak radiative corrections to\nthe $e^- e^+ \\rightarrow f {\\bar f} (\\gamma)$ process with longitudinally\npolarized electrons when for a final state fermions electrons are excluded. The\nfocus of this paper is the investigation of the parity-violating polarization\nasymmetry and forward-backward asymmetry. The calculations are relevant for\nprecision electroweak measurements of the Belle II experiment, which is being\ninstalled on the SuperKEKB $e^- e^+$ collider designed for a center-of-mass\nenergy at the mass of the $\\Upsilon(4S)$ resonance. In this paper we take under\nfull control the bremsstrahlung process at the conditions of Belle\nII/SuperKEKB, the possibilities for soft photon approximation are discussed.\nThe scale of the obtained relative corrections to the parity-violating and\nforward-backward asymmetries is significant and their scattering angle\ndependencies non-trivial.",

    "summary": "Recent studies suggest that dynamical dark energy (DDE) provides a better fit\nto the rising affluence of modern cosmological observations than the\nconcordance model ($\\Lambda$CDM) with a rigid cosmological constant, $\\Lambda$.\nSuch is the case with the running vacuum models (RVMs) and to some extent also\nwith a simple XCDM parametrization. Apart from the cosmic microwave background\n(CMB) anisotropies, the most crucial datasets potentially carrying the DDE\nsignature are: i) baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO), and ii) direct large\nscale structure (LSS) formation data (i.e. the observations on\n$f(z)\\sigma_8(z)$ at different redshifts). As it turns out, analyses mainly\nfocusing on CMB and with insufficient BAO+LSS input, or those just making use\nof gravitational weak-lensing data for the description of structure formation,\ngenerally fail to capture the DDE signature, whereas the few existing studies\nusing a rich set of CMB+BAO+LSS data (see in particular Sol\\`a, G\\'omez-Valent\n\\& de Cruz P\\'erez 2015,2017; and Zhao et al. 2017) do converge to the\nremarkable conclusion that DDE might well be encoded in the current\ncosmological observations. Being the issue so pressing, here we explain both\nanalytically and numerically the origin of the possible hints of DDE in the\ncontext of RVMs, which arise at a significance level of $3-4\\sigma$. By\nperforming a detailed study on the matter and vacuum perturbations within the\nRVMs, and comparing with the XCDM, we show why the running vacuum fully relaxes\nthe existing $\\sigma_8$-tension and accounts for the LSS formation data much\nbetter than the concordance model.",

    "summary": "The nature of chiral phase transition for QCD with two light quark flavors is\nnot yet completely resolved. This is primarily because one has to understand\nwhether or not the anomalous U(1) symmetry in the flavor sector is effectively\nrestored along with the chiral symmetry. Since the physics near the chiral\nphase transition is essentially non-perturbative, we employ first principles\nlattice techniques to address this issue. We use overlap fermions, which have\nexact chiral symmetry on the lattice, to probe the anomalous U(1) symmetry\nviolation of 2+1 flavor dynamical QCD configurations with domain wall fermions.\nThe latter also optimally preserves chiral and flavor symmetries on the\nlattice. We observe that the anomalous U(1) is not effectively restored in the\nchiral crossover region. We perform a systematic study of the finite size and\ncut-off effects since the signals of U(1) violation are sensitive to it. For\nthe same reasons we also compare our results from the continuum extrapolated\nresults of the QCD Dirac spectrum obtained from a different lattice\ndiscretization called Highly Improved Staggered Quarks. Our studies also\nprovide a glimpse of the microscopic topological structures of the QCD medium\nthat are responsible for the strongly interacting nature of the quark gluon\nplasma phase and related to the physics of confinement and chiral symmetry\nbreaking.",

These uncertainties are especially relevant when confronting\na detection claim to the null results from other experiments, since seemingly\nconflicting experimental results may be reconciled when relaxing the\nassumptions about the form of the interaction and/or the velocity distribution.\nWe present in this paper a halo-independent method to calculate the maximum\nnumber of events in a direct detection experiment given a set of null search\nresults, allowing for the first time the scattering to be mediated by an\narbitrary combination of various interactions (concretely we consider up to\n64).

The excellent\nenergy resolution and the large fiducial volume anticipated for the JUNO\ndetector offer exciting opportunities for addressing many important topics in\nneutrino and astro-particle physics. Linear alkylbenzene (LAB) will be used as\nthe solvent for the liquid scintillation system in the central detector of\nJUNO. The light attenuation lengths of LAB should be comparable to the diameter\nof the JUNO detector, hence very good optical transparency is required.\nHowever, the presence of impurities in the LAB renders an intrinsic limit for\nthe transparency. This work focuses on the study of the effects of organic\nimpurities in the LAB, and their light absorption properties particularly in\nthe wavelength region of 350 to 450 nm. we have prepared LAB samples and\nmeasured their light attenuation lengths. These samples were then analyzed by a\ngas chromatography mass spectrometry, and the structure formulas of organic\nimpurities were ascertained. These impurities' light absorption properties in\nthe wavelength region of 350 to 550 nm were theoretically investigated with PCM\nTDDFT. The overall optical transparency of the LAB samples was studied, which\nwould further help us in promoting the LAB preparation technique for the mass\nproduction thereof, thus improving the transparency of the high quality LAB\nsamples in the near future.",

    "summary": "Nambu-Jona-Lasinio-type models are often employed as low-energy models for\nthe theory of the strong interaction to analyze its phase structure at finite\ntemperature and quark chemical potential. In particular at low temperature and\nlarge chemical potential, where the application of fully first-principles\napproaches is currently difficult at best, this class of models still plays a\nprominent role to guide our understanding of the dynamics of dense\nstrong-interaction matter. In this work, we consider a Fierz-complete version\nof the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with two massless quark flavors and study its\nrenormalization group flow and fixed-point structure at leading order of the\nderivative expansion of the effective action. Sum rules for the various\nfour-quark couplings then allow us to monitor the strength of the breaking of\nthe axial $U_{\\rm A}(1)$ symmetry close to and above the phase boundary. We\nfind that the dynamics in the ten-dimensional Fierz-complete space of\nfour-quark couplings can only be reduced to a one-dimensional space associated\nwith the scalar-pseudoscalar coupling in the strict large-$N_{\\rm c}$ limit.\nStill, the interacting fixed point associated with this one-dimensional\nsubspace appears to govern the dynamics at small quark chemical potential even\nbeyond the large-$N_{\\rm c}$ limit. At large chemical potential, corrections\nbeyond the large-$N_{\\rm c}$ limit become important and the dynamics is\ndominated by diquarks, favoring the formation of a chirally symmetric diquark\ncondensate. In this regime, our study suggests that the phase boundary is\nshifted to higher temperatures when a Fierz-complete set of four-quark\ninteractions is considered.",

    "summary": "We examine the type-II two-Higgs-doublet model with a light scalar dark\nmatter ($S$) after imposing the constraints from the Higgs searches at the LHC\nand dark matter experiments. We first assume that both two CP-even Higgses ($h$\nand $H$) are portals between the DM and SM sectors, and the CP-odd Higgs ($A$)\nand $H$ are heavier than 130 GeV. We find that the DM with a mass of $10\\sim\n50$ GeV is disfavored by the joint constraints of the 125 GeV Higgs signal\ndata, the relic density, XENON1T (2017), PandaX-II (2017) and the Fermi-LAT.\nNext, we consider a special scenario in which the heavy CP-even Higgs is taken\nas the 125 GeV Higgs. The light CP-even Higgs is the only portal between the DM\nand SM sectors, and the DM mass is slightly below Higgs resonance. We find that\nthe signal data of the 125 GeV Higgs restrict $\\tan\\beta$ to be in the range of\n$1\\sim 1.5$ for $m_h<$ 62 GeV. The $gg\\to A\\to hZ$ and $b\\bar{b}\\to h \\to\n\\tau^+\\tau^-$ channels at the LHC can impose lower limits and upper limits on\n$\\tan\\beta$, respectively. For appropriate values of $\\tan\\beta$, $\\lambda_h$\nand $m_h$, the DM with a mass of $10\\sim 50$ GeV is allowed by the constraints\nof the Higgs searches at the LHC and dark matter experiments. For example,\n$\\tan\\beta$ is restricted to be in the range of $1.0\\sim1.5$ for 10 GeV $<m_s<$\n26 GeV, and $\\frac{m_h}{2m_S}>$ 1.125 is excluded for 30 GeV $<m_S<$ 50 GeV.",

We thus present various\nnumber susceptibilities along with the corresponding results as obtained by\nlattice quantum chromodynamics collaborations, and comment on their comparison.\nNext, omitting the importance of coupling corrections and considering a\nzero-density toy model for the sake of argument, we focus on corrections due to\nthe small size of heavy-ion collision systems, by means of spatial\ncompactifications. Briefly motivating the relevance of finite size effects in\nheavy-ion physics, in opposition to the compact star physics, we present a few\npreliminary thermodynamic results together with the speed of sound for certain\nfinite size relativistic quantum systems at very high temperature.",

    "summary": "In many models with extended Higgs sectors, $e.g.$ 2HDM, NMSSM, there exists\na light scalar $h$, lighter than the Standard Model (SM) like Higgs, and the\ncoupling of $hZZ$ can be very small, as expected from the likeness of the 125\nGeV Higgs boson measured at the LHC to the SM Higgs boson. Such a light scalar\nwith suppressed couplings to the $Z$ boson would have escaped detection at LEP\ndue to its limited luminosity. With a factor of 1000 higher luminosity and\npolarized beams, the International Linear Collider (ILC) is expected to have\nsubstantial discovery potential for such states. Furthermore, searches for\nadditional scalars at LEP and LHC are usually dependent on the model details,\nsuch as decay channels. Thus, it is necessary to have a more general analysis\nwith model-independent assumptions.\n  In this work, we perform a search for a light higgs boson produced in\nassociation with $Z$ boson at the ILC with a center-of-mass energy of 250 GeV,\nusing the full Geant4-based simulation of the ILD detector concept. In order to\nbe as model-independent as possible, the analysis is performed using the recoil\ntechnique, in particular with the $Z$ boson decaying into a pair of muons. As a\npreliminary result, the ILC's exclusion limits will be shown for different\nhiggs masses between 30 and 115 GeV.",

    "summary": "In cool quark matter, at intermediate densities the excitations of single\nquarks are confined (\"quarkyonic\"). A long ranged confining potential reduces\nthe scattering of such quarks to be essentially one dimensional. As a result\nthe Fermi surface, which is originally isotropic, is unstable to breaking up\ninto a set of patches, where each patch contains a chiral spiral whose\nlongitudinal dynamics is controlled by a Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten (WZNW)\nLagrangian. Transverse fluctuations of the chiral spirals are like those in a\nsmectic liquid crystal, of quartic order in momenta, and disorder the system at\nany nonzero temperature T. The corresponding correlation lengths are\nexponentially large in 1/T, though, so that the many modes in the WZNW\nLagrangian are light. Such a plethora of nearly massless collective modes could\ngreatly contribute to cooling neutron stars. Moving to low density, the chiral\nspirals of quarkyonic matter directly evolve into the pion/kaon condensates of\nhadronic nuclear matter. In Nambu-Jona-Lasinio models, analysis in mean field\ntheory finds a critical endpoint which coincides with a Lifshitz point. From\ngeneral theoretical arguments, and strongly supported by the example of\ninhomogeneous polymers, we argue that large infrared fluctuations wipe out the\nLifshitz point, and produce an intermediate region in which the chiral spirals\nare strongly disordered. There may be evidence for such a region from\nexperimental measurements of fluctuations at the Relativistic Heavy Ion\nCollider.",

The mass distributions exhibit narrow and wide\nbumps at several locations in the 100 - 300 GeV range, between the masses of\nthe daughter particles $A$ and the parent particle $S$, depending on the jet\nsubstructure selection. This striking observation introduces several caveats\nwhen interpreting and comparing experimental results, for the case of\nnon-standard signatures.

    "summary": "Axions and other very light axion-like particles appear in many extensions of\nthe Standard Model, and are leading candidates to compose part or all of the\nmissing matter of the Universe. They also appear in models of inflation, dark\nradiation, or even dark energy, and could solve some long-standing\nastrophysical anomalies. The physics case of these particles has been\nconsiderably developed in recent years, and there are now useful guidelines and\npowerful motivations to attempt experimental detection. Admittedly, the lack of\npositive signal of new physics at the high energy frontier, and in underground\ndetectors searching for weakly interacting massive particles, is also\ncontributing to the increase of the interest in axion searches. The\nexperimental landscape is rapidly evolving, with many novel detection concepts\nand new experiments being proposed lately. An updated account of those\ninitiatives is lacking in the literature. In this review we attempt to provide\nsuch a review. We will focus on the new experimental approaches and their\ncomplementarity, but will also review the most relevant recent results from the\nconsolidated strategies and the prospects of new generation experiments under\nconsideration in the field.

    "summary": "We study the motion of vortex filaments in chiral media, and find a\nsemi-classical analog of the anomaly-induced chiral magnetic effect. The\nhelical solitonic excitations on vortices in a parity-breaking medium are found\nto carry an additional energy flow along the vortex in the direction dictated\nby the sign of chirality imbalance; we call this new transport phenomenon the\nChiral Propulsion Effect (CPE). The dynamics of the filament is described by a\nmodified version of the localized induction equation in the parity-breaking\nbackground. We analyze the linear stability of simple vortex configurations,\nand study the effects of chiral media on the excitation spectrum and the growth\nrate of the unstable modes. It is also shown that, if the equation of motion of\nthe filament is symmetric under the simultaneous reversal of parity and time,\nthe resulting planar solution cannot transport energy.",

    "summary": "There is a growing interest in astrophysical tests of the stability of\ndimensionless fundamental couplings, such as the fine-structure constant\n$\\alpha$, as an optimal probe of new physics. The imminent arrival of the\nESPRESSO spectrograph will soon enable significant gains in the precision and\naccuracy of these tests and widen the range of theoretical models that can be\ntightly constrained. Here we illustrate this by studying proposed extensions of\nthe Bekenstein-type models for the evolution of $\\alpha$ that allow different\ncouplings of the scalar field to both dark matter and dark energy. We use a\ncombination of current astrophysical and local laboratory data (from tests with\natomic clocks) to show that these couplings are constrained to parts per\nmillion level, with the constraints being dominated by the atomic clocks. We\nalso quantify the expected improvements from ESPRESSO and other future\nspectrographs, and briefly discuss possible observational strategies, showing\nthat these facilities can improve current constraints by more than an order of\nmagnitude.",

A remarkable regularity was suggested in previous\nstudies to look for the light speed variation from high energy photon events of\nGamma Ray Bursts (GRBs). We provide a general analysis on the data of 25 bright\nGRBs observed by the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (FGST). Such method allows\na completed scan over all possibilities in a more clean and impartial way\nwithout any bias compared to previous intuitive analysis. The results show that\nwith the increase in the intrinsic energies of photons, such regularity truly\nemerges and gradually becomes significant.

    "summary": "With the Planck 2015 result, most of the well known canonical large field\ninflation models turned out to be strongly disfavored. Axion inflation is one\nof such models which is becoming marginalized with the increasing precession of\nCMB data. In this paper, we have shown that with a simple Galileon type\nmodification to the marginally favored axion model calling G-axion, we can turn\nthem into one of the most favored models with its detectable prediction of $r$\nand $n_s$ within its PLANCK $1\\sigma $ range for a wide range of parameters.\nInterestingly it is this modification which plays the important role in turning\nthe inflationary predictions to be independent of the explicit value of axion\ndecay constant $f$. However, dynamics after the inflation turned out to have a\nnon-trivial dependence on $f$. For each G-axion model there exists a critical\nvalue of $f_c$ such that for $f>f_c$ we have the oscillating phase after\ninflation and for $f<f_c$ we have non-oscillatory phase. Therefore, we obtained\na range of sub-Planckian value of model parameters which give rise to\nconsistent inflation. However for sub-Planckian axion decay constant the\ninflaton field configuration appeared to be singular after the end of\ninflation. To reheat the universe we, therefore, employ the instant preheating\nmechanism at the instant of first zero crossing of the inflaton. To our\nsurprise, the instant preheating mechanism turned out to be inefficient as\nopposed to usual non-oscillatory quintessence model. For another class of\nG-axion model with super-Planckian axion decay constant, we performed in detail\nthe reheating constraints analysis considering the latest PLANCK result.",

    "summary": "The public collider phenomenology computing tool CheckMATE (Check Models at\nTerascale Energies) was originally designed to allow theorists to quickly test\ntheir favourite BSM models against various existing LHC analyses performed by\nATLAS and CMS.

Currently, it contains more than 50 individual ATLAS or CMS\nanalyses whose several hundred signal regions target various final states as\nthey typically appear in theories beyond the Standard Model. In this study, we\nextend this functionality to allow sensitivity studies for the International\nLinear Collider.

In short\nthe thermal evolution of a neutron star is studied with three neutron star\nmasses (1.0, 1.4, 1.8 solar masses) and by including the effect of axion\nemission for different axion masses ($m_{a}=10^{-5}\\rm{eV}, 10^{-3}\\rm{eV},\n10^{-2}\\rm{eV}$) and compared with the same when the axion emission is not\nconsidered.

    "summary": "We construct an effective Lagrangian for Yang-Mills theories with $n$ extra\ndimensions. We start from a field theory governed by the extra-dimensional\nPoincar\\'e group ISO$(1,3+n)$ and by the extended gauge group $SU(N,{\\cal\nM}^{4+n})$, characterized by an unknown energy scale $\\Lambda$ and assumed to\nbe valid at energies far below this scale. Assuming that the size of the extra\ndimensions is much larger than the distance scale at which this theory is\nvalid, we construct an effective theory with symmetry groups ISO$(1,3)$,\n$SU(N,{\\cal M}^{4})$. Such theories are connected by a canonical transformation\nthat hides the extended symmetries ISO$(1,3+n)$, $SU(N,{\\cal M}^{4+n})$ into\nthe standard ISO(1,3), $SU(N,{\\cal M}^{4})$, thus generating KK gauge masses.\nUsing a set of orthogonal functions $\\{f^{(\\underline{0})},\nf^{(\\underline{m})}(\\bar x)\\}$, defined by the Casimir invariant $\\bar{P}^2$ of\nthe translations subgroup $T(n)\\subset$ISO$(n)$, we expand the degrees of\nfreedom of ISO(1,3+n), $SU(N,{\\cal M}^{4+n})$ in general Fourier series, whose\ncoefficients are the degrees of freedom of ISO(1,3), $SU(N,{\\cal M}^{4})$.\nThese functions, which correspond to the projection on the basis $\\{|\\bar{x}\n\\big >\\}$ of the discrete basis $\\{|0\\big >,|p^{(\\underline{m})}\\big >\\}$\ngenerated by $\\bar {P}^2$, are central to define the effective theory.\nComponents along the ground state $f^{(\\underline{0})}=\\big <\\bar x|0\\big>$ do\nnot receive mass at the compactification scale, so they are identified with the\nstandard Yang-Mills fields; components along excited states\n$f^{(\\underline{m})}=\\big<\\bar x|p^{(\\underline{m})}\\big>$ receive mass at this\nscale, so they correspond to KK excitations.

    "summary": "Simulations of neutrino flavor evolution in compact merger environments have\nshown that neutrino flavor, and hence nucleosynthesis, can be strongly affected\nby the presence of matter-neutrino resonances (MNRs), where there is a\ncancelation between the matter and the neutrino potential. Simulations\nperformed thus far follow flavor evolution along a single neutrino trajectory,\nbut self-consistency requires all trajectories to be treated simultaneously,\nand it has not been known whether MNR phenomena would still occur in\nmulti-angle models. In this paper, we present the first fully multi-angle\ncalculations of MNR. We find that familiar MNR phenomena, where neutrinos\ntransform to a greater extent than anti-neutrinos and a feedback mechanism\nmaintains the cancellation between the matter and neutrino potential, still\noccurs for a subset of angular bins, although the flavor transformation is not\nas efficient as in the single-angle case. In addition, we find other types of\nflavor transformation that are not seen in single-angle simulations. These\nflavor transformation phenomena appear to be robust and are present for a wide\nrange of model parameters, as long as an MNR is present. Although computational\nconstraints currently limit us to models with spherical symmetry, our results\nsuggest that the presence of an MNR generally leads to large-scale neutrino\nflavor evolution in multi-angle systems.",

    "summary": "The only first principle knowledge of the QCD equation of state at finite\nbaryonic density is given from Lattice QCD as a Taylor expansion around $\\mu_B\n= 0$.

The expected critical behavior of QCD is in the same\nstatic universality class as the 3D Ising model.

    "summary": "We explore the possibility that bound states involving dark matter particles\ncould be detected by resonance searches at the LHC, and the generic\nimplications of such scenarios for indirect and direct detection. We\ndemonstrate that resonance searches are complementary to mono-jet searches and\ncan probe dark matter masses above 1 TeV with current LHC data. We argue that\nthis parameter regime, where the bound-state resonance channel is the most\nsensitive probe of the dark sector, arises most naturally in the context of\nnon-trivial dark sectors with large couplings, nearly-degenerate\ndark-matter-like states, and multiple force carriers. The presence of bound\nstates detectable by the LHC implies a minimal Sommerfeld enhancement that is\nappreciable, and potentially also radiative bound state formation in the\nGalactic halo, leading to large signals in indirect searches. We calculate\nthese complementary constraints, which favor either models where the\nbound-state-forming dark matter constitutes a small fraction of the total\ndensity, or models where the late-time annihilation is suppressed at low\nvelocities or late times. We present concrete examples of models that satisfy\nall these constraints and where the LHC resonance search is the most sensitive\nprobe of the dark sector.",

    "summary": "We have used the Arecibo Telescope to carry out one of the deepest-ever\nintegrations in radio astronomy, targetting the redshifted conjugate satellite\nOH 18 cm lines at $z \\approx 0.247$ towards PKS1413+135. The satellite OH 1720\nand 1612 MHz lines are respectively in emission and absorption, with exactly\nthe same line shapes due to population inversion in the OH ground state levels.\nSince the 1720 and 1612 MHz line rest frequencies have different dependences on\nthe fine structure constant $\\alpha$ and the proton-electron mass ratio $\\mu$,\na comparison between their measured redshifts allows one to probe changes in\n$\\alpha$ and $\\mu$ with cosmological time. In the case of conjugate satellite\nOH 18 cm lines, the predicted perfect cancellation of the sum of the line\noptical depths provides a strong test for the presence of systematic effects\nthat might limit their use in probing fundamental constant evolution. A\nnon-parametric analysis of our new Arecibo data yields $\\left[\\Delta X/X\n\\right] = (+0.97 \\pm 1.52) \\times 10^{-6}$, where $X \\equiv \\mu \\alpha^2$.\nCombining this with our earlier results from the Arecibo Telescope and the\nWesterbork Synthesis Radio Telescope, we obtain $\\left[\\Delta X/X \\right] =\n(-1.0 \\pm 1.3) \\times 10^{-6}$, consistent with no changes in the quantity $\\mu\n\\alpha^2$ over the last 2.9~Gyr. This is the most stringent present constraint\non fractional changes in $\\mu \\alpha^2$ from astronomical spectroscopy, and\nwith no evidence for systematic effects.",

    "summary": "We present a thorough analysis of unpolarized Drell-Yan (DY) pair production\nin pion-nucleus scattering. On the nucleus side, we use nuclear parton\ndistributions along with parametrisations of the nucleon partonic transverse\ndistribution available in the literature. Partonic longitudinal and transverse\ndistributions of the pion are those obtained in a recent calculation in a\nNambu-Jona Lasinio (NJL) framework, with Pauli-Villars regularization. The\nscale of the NJL model is fixed by a comparison between NLO predictions based\non NJL evolved pion distributions and rapidity differential DY cross sections\ndata. The resulting distributions are then used to describe, up to\nnext-to-leading logarithmic accuracy, the transverse momentum spectrum of\ndilepton pairs up to a transverse momentum of 2 GeV. With no additional\nparameters, fair agreement is found with available pion-nucleus data,\nconfirming the virtues of the NJL description of pion parton structure. We find\nsizable evolution effects on the shape of the distributions and on the\ngenerated average transverse momentum of the dilepton pair. We discuss the\npossibility of extracting details on pion unpolarized transverse momentum\ndependent parton distribution from pion nucleus DY data. In this respect, the\nregion of low invariant mass of the lepton pair appears to be favored to\ndiscriminate between different descriptions of the non-perturbative pion\ntransverse structure.",

    "summary": "The standard perception is that the detection of high energy (TeV energies\nand above) neutrinos from an astrophysical object is a conclusive evidence for\nthe presence of hadronic cosmic rays at the source. In the present work we\ndemonstrate that TeV neutrinos can also be originated from energetic electrons\nvia electromagnetic interactions in different potential cosmic ray sources with\nflux levels comparable to that of the hadronic originated neutrinos at high\nenergies. Our findings thus imply that at least a part of the neutrinos\nobserved by Icecube observatory may be originated from energetic electrons. The\npresent analysis further suggests that only a combine study of TeV gamma rays\nand neutrinos over a wide energy range from an astrophysical object can\nunambiguously identify the nature of their parents, hadrons or leptons.",

In\nother words, any particle that can be produced at the LHC must either have been\nin thermal equilibrium with the Standard Model at some point or must be\nproduced via the decays of another hidden sector particle that has been in\nthermal equilibrium. To reach this conclusion, we parametrise the cross section\nconnecting the Standard Model to the hidden sector in a very general way and\nuse methods from linear programming to calculate the largest possible number of\nLHC events compatible with the requirement of non-thermalisation.

    "summary": "The dynamics of baryon-antibaryon annihilation and reproduction ($B{\\bar B}\n\\leftrightarrow 3 M$) is studied within the Parton-Hadron-String Dynamics\n(PHSD) transport approach for Pb+Pb and Au+Au collisions as a function of\ncentrality from lower Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) up to Large Hadron\nCollider (LHC) energies on the basis of the quark rearrangement model (QRM). At\nRelativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) energies we find a small net reduction\nof baryon-antibaryon ($B {\\bar B}$) pairs while for the LHC energy of\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 2.76 GeV a small net enhancement is found relative to\ncalculations without annihilation (and reproduction) channels.

This\nis in line with the observation that no substantial deviation between the data\nand statistical hadronization model (SHM) calculations is seen for\nantihyperons, since according to the PHSD analysis the antihyperons should be\nmodified by the same amount as antiprotons. As the PHSD results for particle\nratios are in line with the ALICE data (within error bars) this might point\ntowards a deviation from statistical equilibrium in the hadronization (at least\nfor protons/antiprotons). Furthermore, we find that the $B {\\bar B}\n\\leftrightarrow 3 M$ reactions are more effective at lower SPS energies where a\nnet suppression for antiprotons and antihyperons up to a factor of 2 -- 2.5 can\nbe extracted from the PHSD calculations for central Au+Au collisions.",

A careful analysis resolves\nthe tension on symmetric versus asymmetric bounce in this model, showing that\nthe bounce must be asymmetric and symmetric bounce is physically inconsistent,\nin contrast to the standard LQC. In addition, the current observations only\nallow a scenario where the pre-bounce branch is asymptotically de Sitter,\nsimilar to a quantization of the Schwarzschild interior in LQC, and the\npost-bounce branch yields the classical general relativity. For a quadratic\npotential, we find that a slow-roll inflation generically happens after the\nbounce, which is quite similar to what happens in LQC.",

    "summary": "We perform a complete calculation of electron-seeded pair-creation (the\ntrident process) in a constant crossed electromagnetic background. Unlike\nearlier treatments, we include the interference between exchange diagrams. We\nfind this exchange interference can be written as a contribution solely to the\none-step process, and for small quantum nonlinearity parameter is of the same\norder as other one-step terms. We find the exchange interference further\nsuppresses the one-step process in this parameter regime. Our findings further\nsupport the crucial assumption made in laser-plasma simulation codes that at\nhigh intensities, the trident process can be well-approximated by repeated\niteration of the single-vertex subprocesses. The applicability of this\nassumption to higher-vertex processes has fundamental importance to the\ndevelopment of simulation capabilities.",

Taking into account theoretical constraints\nfrom perturbativity and vacuum stability, we compute next-to-leading-order\nelectroweak and QCD corrections to the decays $h\\to WW/ZZ \\to 4$ fermions of\nthe light Higgs boson for some scenarios proposed in the literature. We\nformulate two renormalization schemes and investigate the conversion of the\ninput parameters between the schemes, finding sizeable effects.

We demonstrate that\nthis model can address the key problems of astrophysical neutrino data, such as\nthe different observed spectral indices in the high-energy starting and\nthrough-going muon samples, a possible anisotropy due to Galactic events, the\nnon-observation of point sources, and the constraint from the extragalatic\ndiffuse gamma-ray background. Furthermore, the recently observed muon track\nwith a deposited energy of 4.5 PeV might be interpreted as evidence for the\nextragalactic photo-hadronic contribution. We perform the analysis based on the\nobserved events instead of the unfolded fluxes by computing the probability\ndistributions for the event type and reconstructed neutrino energy.

    "summary": "Massive spinning particles, if present during inflation, lead to a\ndistinctive bispectrum of primordial perturbations, the shape and amplitude of\nwhich depend on the masses and spins of the extra particles. This signal, in\nturn, leaves an imprint in the statistical distribution of galaxies; in\nparticular, as a non-vanishing galaxy bispectrum, which can be used to probe\nthe masses and spins of these particles. In this paper, we present for the\nfirst time a new theoretical template for the bispectrum generated by massive\nspinning particles, valid for a general triangle configuration. We then proceed\nto perform a Fisher-matrix forecast to assess the potential of two\nnext-generation spectroscopic galaxy surveys, EUCLID and DESI, to constrain the\nprimordial non-Gaussianity sourced by these extra particles. We model the\ngalaxy bispectrum using tree-level perturbation theory, accounting for\nredshift-space distortions and the Alcock-Paczynski effect, and forecast\nconstraints on the primordial non-Gaussianity parameters marginalizing over all\nrelevant biases and cosmological parameters. Our results suggest that these\nsurveys would potentially be sensitive to any primordial non-Gaussianity with\nan amplitude larger than $f_{\\rm NL}\\approx 1$, for massive particles with\nspins 2, 3, and 4. Interestingly, if non-Gaussianities are present at that\nlevel, these surveys will be able to infer the masses of these spinning\nparticles to within tens of percent. If detected, this would provide a very\nclear window into the particle content of our Universe during inflation.",

While in conventional PS models, the symmetry\nbreaking scale and the mass of the resulting vector leptoquark are stringently\nconstrained by $K_L\\to\\mu e$ and $K\\to\\pi\\mu e$, the scale can be lowered to a\nfew TeV by implementing the PS gauge group in the five-dimensional\nRandall-Sundrum background. The symmetry breaking is achieved by the choice of\nboundary conditions and the constraints from kaon physics can be avoided by\nimplementing the SM fermions as bulk fields with different zero mode\nlocalizations for the three generations. We consider the flavour phenomenology\nof this model in the context of the hints for lepton flavour universality\nviolation in semileptonic $B$ decays. Concerning $b\\to s\\ell^+\\ell^-$\ntransitions, the observed deviations from the SM predictions (including $R(K)$\nand $R(K^*)$) can be explained with natural values for the free parameters of\nthe model without fine-tuning in other flavour observables (like\n$B_s-\\overline{B}_s$ mixing). Even though we find sizable effects in $R(D)$,\n$R(D^*)$ and $R(J/\\Psi)$ one cannot account for the current central values in\nthe constrained setup of our minimal model due to the stringent constraints\nfrom $D-\\bar D$ mixing and $\\tau\\to 3\\mu$.",

The main limitations of this method comes from its\nnonrelativistic nature and its computational cost, the latter hampering the\ndirect evaluation of the inclusive cross sections as measured by experiments.\nWe extend the applicability of GFMC in the quasielastic region to intermediate\nmomentum transfers by performing the calculations in a reference frame that\nminimizes nucleon momenta. Additional relativistic effects in the kinematics\nare accounted for employing the two-fragment model. In addition, we developed a\nnovel algorithm, based on the concept of first-kind scaling, to compute the\ninclusive electromagnetic cross section of $^4$He through an accurate and\nreliable interpolation of the response functions. A very good agreement is\nobtained between theoretical and experimental cross sections for a variety of\nkinematical setups.

We compare predictions made using a framework built upon a\nFaddeev equation kernel and interaction vertices that possess QCD-like momentum\ndependence with results obtained using a confining, symmetry-preserving\ntreatment of a vector$\\,\\otimes\\,$vector contact-interaction in a widely-used\nleading-order (rainbow-ladder) truncation of QCD's Dyson-Schwinger equations.\nThis comparison explains that the contact-interaction framework produces hard\nform factors, curtails some quark orbital angular momentum correlations within\na baryon, and suppresses two-loop diagrams in the elastic and transition\nelectromagnetic currents. Such defects are rectified in our QCD-based approach\nand, by contrasting the results obtained for the same observables in both\ntheoretical schemes, shows those objects which are most sensitive to the\nmomentum dependence of elementary quantities in QCD.",

The\ndynamical structure factors for density and spin fluctuations of the strongly\ninteracting neutron matter, expected in the neutrino decoupling regions of\nsupernovae and neutron star mergers, are calculated in the virial expansion for\nthe first time. Correlations due to nucleon-nucleon interactions are taken into\naccount using a pseudo-potential that reproduces measured nucleon-nucleon phase\nshifts, and we find that attractive s-wave interactions enhance the density\nresponse and suppress the spin response of neutron matter. The net effect of\nneutron correlations is to strongly suppress backscattering. Moreover, we find\nnearly exact scaling laws for the response functions, valid for the range $T =\n5 - 10$ MeV and q < 30 MeV, allowing us to obtain analytic results for the\ndynamic structure factors at second-order in the fugacity of the neutron gas.\nWe find that the modification of scattering rates depends on the energy and\nmomentum exchanged, implying that dynamical structure factors are essential to\ndescribe neutrino decoupling in supernovae and neutron star mergers.",

    "summary": "We present a new cosmological model of the Universe based on the two\ndiscoveries: 1. cosmological constant is very small, and 2. Nature shows a new\nlaw in physics called \"Multiple Point Principle\" (MPP). The MPP predicts the\ntwo degenerate vacua of the Universe with VEV $v_1\\approx 246$ Gev and $v_2\\sim\n10^{18}$ GeV, which provide masses of the Higgs boson and top-quark. A new\ncosmological model assumes the formation of two universal bubbles. The Universe\nat first stage of its existing is a bubble with a de-Sitter spacetime inside,\nhaving black-holes-hedgehogs as topological defects of the vacuum. Such a\nbubble has a \"false vacuum\" with VEV $v_2$, which decays very quickly. Cooling\nUniverse has a new phase transition, transforming the \"false\" vacuum to the\n\"true\" (Electroweak) vacuum. Hedgehogs confined, and the universal bubble is\ntransformed into the bubble having spacetime with FLRW-metric and the vacuum\nwith new topological defects of $U(1)_{(el-mag)}$ group: magnetic vortices and\nSidharth's pointlike defects. The problem of stability/metastability of the\nEW-vacuum is investigated. Noncommutativity of the vacua spacetime manifold is\ndiscussed. The prediction of a new physics is given by the future observations\nat LHC of the triplet $SU(2)$ Higgs bosons (at energies $E\\sim 10$ TeV), and/or\nof the new bound states $6t + 6\\bar t$ formed by top-antitop quarks (at $E\\sim\n1$ TeV).

To\nresolve this puzzling feature, a relativistic analogue of Bogoliubov\ntransformation, which preserves CP but explicitly breaks C and P separately,\nwas introduced together with the notions of a Bogoliubov quasiparticle and an\nanalogue of the energy gap in BCS theory. The idea of Majorana neutrino as\nBogoliubov quasiparticle was then suggested. In this paper, we study the vacuum\nstructure of the Bogoliubov quasiparticle which becomes heavy by absorbing the\nC-breaking. By treating an infinitesimally small C violating term as an\nanalogue of the chiral symmetry breaking nucleon mass in the model of Nambu and\nJona-Lasinio, we construct an explicit form of the vacuum of the Bogoliubov\nquasiparticle which defines Majorana neutrinos in seesaw mechanism. The vacuum\nof the Bogoliubov quasiparticle thus constructed has an analogous condensate\nstructure as the vacuum of the quasiparticle (nucleon) in the\nNambu--Jona-Lasinio model.",

    "summary": "QCD monopoles are magnetically charged quasiparticles whose Bose-Einstein\ncondensation (BEC) at $T<T_c$ creates electric confinement and flux tubes.

In this paper, we study the phenomenon of chiral\nsymmetry breaking and its relation to magnetic monopoles. Specifically, we\nstudy the eigenvalue spectrum of the Dirac operator in the basis of fermionic\nzero modes in an SU(2) monopole background. We find that as the temperature\napproaches the deconfinement temperature $T_c$ from above, the eigenvalue\nspectrum has a finite density at $\\omega = 0$, indicating the presence of a\nchiral condensate. In addition, we find the critical scaling of the eigenvalue\ngap to be consistent with that of the correlation length in the 3d Ising model\nand the BEC transition of monopoles on the lattice.",

It is a two dimensional scan of measurements of particle spectra\nand fluctuations in proton-proton, proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus\ninteractions as a function of collision energy and system size, corresponding\nto a two dimensional phase diagram (temperature T - baryonic chemical potential\n$\\mu_B$). New NA61/SHINE results are presented here, such as transverse\nmomentum and multiplicity fluctuations in Ar+Sc collisions compared to\nNA61/SHINE p+p and Be+Be data, as well as to earlier NA49 A+A results.\nRecently, a preliminary signature for the new size dependent effect - rapid\nchanges in system size dependence was observed in NA61-SHINE data, labeled as\npercolation threshold or onset of fireball.

    "summary": "Within the parameter space of equation of state (EOS) of dense neutron-rich\nmatter limited by existing constraints mainly from terrestrial nuclear\nexperiments, we investigate how the neutron star maximum mass\n$M_{\\rm{max}}>2.01\\pm0.04$ M$_\\odot$, radius $10.62<R_{\\rm{1.4}}< 12.83$ km and\ntidal deformability $\\Lambda_{1.4}\\leq800$ of canonical neutron stars all\ntogether constrain the EOS of dense neutron-rich nucleonic matter.

The $J_0$ largely controls\nthe maximum mass of neutron stars. While the EOS with $J_0=0$ is sufficiently\nstiff to support neutron stars as massive as 2.37 M$_{\\odot}$, to support the\nones as massive as 2.74 M$_{\\odot}$ (composite mass of GW170817) requires $J_0$\nto be larger than its currently known maximum value of about 400 MeV. The upper\nlimit on the tidal deformability of $\\Lambda_{1.4}=800$ from the recent\nobservation of GW170817 is found to provide upper limits on some EOS parameters\nconsistent with but less restrictive than the existing constraints of other\nobservables studied.",

    "summary": "Integrating out high energy degrees of freedom to yield a low energy\neffective field theory leads to a loss of information with a concomitant\nincrease in entropy. We obtain the effective field theory of a light scalar\nfield interacting with heavy fields after tracing out the heavy degrees of\nfreedom from the time evolved density matrix. The initial density matrix\ndescribes the light field in its ground state and the heavy fields in\nequilibrium at a common temperature $T$. For $T=0$, we obtain the reduced\ndensity matrix in a perturbative expansion, it reveals an emergent mixed state\nas a consequence of the entanglement between light and heavy fields. We obtain\nthe effective action that determines the time evolution of the \\emph{reduced}\ndensity matrix for the light field in a non-perturbative Dyson resummation of\none-loop correlations of the heavy fields. The Von-Neumann \\emph{entanglement\nentropy} associated with the reduced density matrix is obtained for the\nnon-resonant and resonant cases in the asymptotic long time limit. In the\nnon-resonant case the reduced density matrix displays an \\emph{incipient}\nthermalization albeit with a wave-vector, time and coupling dependent\n\\emph{effective temperature} as a consequence of memory of initial conditions.\nThe entanglement entropy is time independent and is the \\emph{thermal entropy}\nfor this effective, non-equilibrium temperature. In the resonant case the light\nfield fully \\emph{thermalizes} with the heavy fields, the reduced density\nmatrix looses memory of the initial conditions and the entanglement entropy\nbecomes the \\emph{thermal entropy} of the light field. We discuss the relation\nbetween the entanglement entropy ultraviolet divergences and renormalization.",

Single Compton scattered electrons, produced by gammas emitted\nfrom the de-excitation of $^7$Li* in coincidence with the beam pulse, along\nwith calibration gamma sources, are used to extract the recombination\nprobability as a function of energy and electron drift field. The ARIS results\nhave been compared with three recombination probability parameterizations\n(Thomas-Imel, Doke-Birks, and PARIS), allowing for the definition of a fully\ncomprehensive model of the liquid argon response to nuclear and electronic\nrecoils in the energy range of interest for dark matter searches.",

    "summary": "Many composite Higgs models predict the existence of vector-like quarks with\nmasses outside the reach of the LHC, e.g. $m_Q \\gtrsim 2$ TeV, in particular if\nthese models contain a dark matter candidate. In such models the mass of the\nnew resonances is bounded from above to satisfy the constraint from the\nobserved relic density. We therefore develop new strategies to search for\nvector-like quarks at a future $100$ TeV collider and evaluate what masses and\ninteractions can be probed. We find that masses as large as $\\sim 6.4$ ($\\sim\n9$) TeV can be tested if the fermionic resonances decay into Standard Model\n(dark matter) particles. We also discuss the complementarity of dark matter\nsearches, showing that most of the parameter space can be closed. On balance,\nthis study motivates further the consideration of a higher-energy hadron\ncollider for a next generation of facilities.",

Our results can also be used as an estimate for the\npotential of a Compact Linear Collider (CLIC). We find that heavy sterile\nneutrinos that simultaneously explain both, the observed light neutrino\noscillations and the baryon asymmetry of the universe, can be found in\ndisplaced vertex searches at ILC. We further study the precision at which the\nflavour-dependent active-sterile mixing angles can be measured. The measurement\nof the ratios of these mixing angles, and potentially also of the heavy\nneutrino mass splitting, can test whether minimal type I seesaw models are the\norigin of the light neutrino masses, and it can be a first step towards probing\nleptogenesis as the mechanism of baryogenesis. Our results show that the ILC\ncan be used as a discovery machine for New Physics in feebly coupled sectors\nthat can address fundamental questions in particle physics and cosmology.",

It is\nillustrated that a chiral expansion of the one-loop contributions is rapidly\nconverging up to quark masses that generously encompasses the mass of the\nphysical strange quark. We express the successive orders in terms of physical\nmeson and baryon masses. In addition, owing to specific correlations amongst\nthe chiral moments, we suggest a reordering of terms that make the convergence\nproperties more manifest. Explicit expressions up to chiral order five are\nderived for all baryon masses at the one-loop level. The baryon masses obtained\ndo not depend on the renormalization scale. The novel chiral ordering is tested\nagainst QCD lattice data at N$^3$LO, where the low-energy parameters are\nsystematically correlated by large-$N_c$ sum rules. A reproduction of the\nbaryon masses from PACS-CS, LHPC, HSC, NPLQCD, QCDSF-UKQCD and ETMC is achieved\nfor ensembles with pion and kaon masses smaller than 600 MeV.

    "summary": "The concept of a hybrid readout of a time projection chamber is presented. It\ncombines a GEM-based amplification and a pad-based anode plane with a pixel\nchip as readout electronics. This way, a high granularity enabling to identify\nelectron clusters from the primary ionisation is achieved as well as\nflexibility and large anode coverage. The benefits of this high granularity, in\nparticular for dE/dx measurements, are outlined and results of a\nsimulation-based performance study are given. The structure of the first\nprototype board is discussed, including adaptions based on a very preliminary\nfirst measurement for a second production towards a proof-of-principle.",

We investigate new constraints on the model and\nreadjust free parameters accordingly. We show that UHECR acceleration above\nabout 10^{11} GeV remains consistent with observation.

We\nbegin by providing a brief overview of frame problems in the history of science\nbefore outlining the crux of the frame problem in inflationary cosmology.

We then specialize to two-field models, examining the impact\nof isocurvature effects on the inflationary observables in a frame-covariant\nmanner. We study the phenomenology of two particular models, a minimal\npolynomial model and a nonminimal model inspired by Higgs inflation. We observe\nthat in the latter scenario, isocurvature effects are greatly enhanced. Moving\nbeyond the tree-level approximation, we outline how our approach may be\nextended at the quantum level through the Vilkovisky--De Witt formalism and the\ngeneralization of frame tensors to configuration space, leading to a fully\nframe-invariant effective action. Finally, we summarize our findings and\npresent possible future directions of research on the topic of frame\ncovariance.",

We\ndetermined the pion GDAs by analyzing Belle data on the differential cross\nsection for the two-photon process $\\gamma^* \\gamma \\to \\pi^0 \\pi^0$. From the\ndetermined GDAs, we calculated timelike gravitational form factors of the pion\nand they were converted to the spacelike form factors by using the dispersion\nrelation.

In the\ngauge-invariant $\\rm{\\overline{MS}}$-scheme this property holds at least at\nthis order. To study whether this property is true in all gauge-invariant\nschemes, we consider the $\\rm{MS}$-like schemes in QCD and the QED-limit of the\nGCR in the $\\rm{\\overline{MS}}$-scheme and in the $\\rm{MOM}$ and the $\\rm{OS}$\nschemes. In these schemes we confirm the existence of the $\\beta$-function\nfactorization in the QCD and QED variants of the GCR. The problem of the\npossible $\\beta$-factorization in the gauge-dependent renormalization schemes\nin QCD is studied. We consider the gauge non-invariant $\\rm{mMOM}$ and\n$\\rm{MOMgggg}$-schemes and demonstrate that in the $\\rm{mMOM}$ scheme at the\n$\\mathcal{O}(a^3_s)$ level the $\\beta$-factorization is valid for three values\nof the gauge parameter $\\xi$ only, namely for $\\xi=-3, -1$ and $\\xi=0$. In the\n$\\mathcal{O}(a^4_s)$ order of PT it remains valid only for case of the Landau\ngauge $\\xi=0$.\n  The consideration of these two schemes for the QCD GCR allows us to conclude\nthat the factorization of RG $\\beta$-function will always be implemented in any\n$\\rm{MOM}$-like schemes with linear covariant gauge at $\\xi=0$ and $\\xi=-3$ at\nthe $\\mathcal{O}(a^3_s)$ level. It is demonstrated that if factorization\nproperty for the $\\rm{MS}$-like schemes is true in all orders of PT, as\ntheoretically indicated, then the factorization will also occur in the\narbitrary $\\rm{MOM}$-like scheme in the Landau gauge in all orders of PT as\nwell.",

    "summary": "We present an extension of the Standard Model, containing a fermion dark\nmatter candidate and two real scalar singlets, where the observed dark matter\nabundance is produced via freeze-out before the electroweak phase transition.\nWe show that in this case the dark matter annihilation channels determining its\nfreeze-out are different from those producing indirect detection signal. We\npresent a benchmark model where the indirect annihilation cross-section is\nsignificantly larger than the freeze-out one. The model also has a\ngravitational wave signature due to the first order electroweak phase\ntransition.",

    "summary": "Making use of definitive new lattice computations of the Standard Model\nthermodynamics during the quantum chromodynamic (QCD) phase transition, we\ncalculate the enhancement in the mass distribution of primordial black holes\n(PBHs) due to the softening of the equation of state. We find that the\nenhancement peaks at approximately $0.7M_\\odot$, with the formation rate\nincreasing by at least two orders of magnitude due to the softening of the\nequation of state at this time, with a range of approximately\n$0.3M_\\odot<M<1.4M_\\odot$ at full width half-maximum. PBH formation is\nincreased by a smaller amount for PBHs with masses spanning a large range,\n$10^{-3}M_\\odot<M_{\\rm PBH}<10^{3}M_\\odot$, which includes the masses of the\nBHs that LIGO detected. The most significant source of uncertainty in the\nnumber of PBHs formed is now due to unknowns in the formation process, rather\nthan from the phase transition. A near scale-invariant density power spectrum\ntuned to generate a population with mass and merger rate consistent with that\ndetected by LIGO should also produce a much larger energy density of PBHs with\nsolar mass. This solar-mass population could constitute a significant fraction\nof the cold dark matter density.",

Focusing on the Higgs self coupling as a\nspecial interest, we derive the precision as a function of various improvable\nparameters such as tag and mis-tag rates of tau-leptons, heavy flavor jets,\nphoton identification and di-photon mass resolution to take into account future\nphenomenological studies.

    "summary": "The modifications of the masses of the $B$ and $\\bar B$ mesons in asymmetric\nnuclear matter in the presence of strong magnetic fields, are investigated\nusing a chiral effective model. The medium modifications of these open bottom\nmesons arise due to their interactions with the scalar mesons and the nucleons.\nIn the magnetized nuclear matter, the proton has contributions from the Landau\nlevels. In the chiral effective model, the masses of the $B$ and $\\bar B$ are\ncalculated from the leading term, namely the vectorial Weinberg Tomozawa term\nas well as from the next to leading order contributions, i.e., due to the\nscalar exchange and the range terms. Due to the Weinberg-Tomozawa term, the\n$\\bar B$ mesons experience an attractive interaction in the symmetric nuclear\nmatter, whereas the $B$ mesons have a repulsive interaction. Inclusion of the\ncontributions from the scalar exchange and the range terms as well, leads to\ndrop of the masses of both $B$ and $\\bar B$ mesons. The effect of the isospin\nasymmetry breaks the mass degeneracy of the $B^+$ and $B^0$ (as well as of the\n$B^-$ and $\\bar {B^0}$) mesons, and its effect is observed to be large at high\ndensities. The effects of anomalous magnetic moments of the nucleons are taken\ninto account in the present study of the masses of the open bottom mesons in\nmagnetized nuclear matter.",

To account for the attenuation of these high energy gamma-rays by the\nextragalactic background light, we use template EBL models. During different\nepochs of flaring the calculated intrinsic fluxes are not the same due to the\nchange in the power-law dependence of the seed photon densities in the tail\nregion of the SSC band.

One of the notable features of our\nmodulus D-term inflation scenario is that the global U(1) remains unbroken in\nthe vacuum and hence our model is not plagued by the cosmic string problem\nwhich can exclude most of the conventional D-term inflation models proposed so\nfar due to the CMB observations.",

    "summary": "We investigate the transverse momentum dependent parton distributions (TMDs)\nin the quasi-parton-distribution framework. The long standing hurdle of the\nso-called pinch pole singularity from the space-like gauge links in the TMD\ndefinitions can be resolved by the finite length of the gauge link along the\nhadron moving direction. In addition, with the soft factor subtraction, the\nquasi-TMD is free of linear divergence. We further demonstrate that the energy\nevolution equation of the quasi-TMD a.k.a. the Collins-Soper evolution, only\ndepends on the hadron momentum. This leads to a clear matching between the\nquasi-TMD and the standard TMDs.",

    "summary": "Recent direct measurements of Galactic cosmic ray spectra by\nballoon/space-borne detectors reveal spectral hardenings of all major nucleus\nspecies at rigidities of a few hundred GV. The all-sky diffuse gamma-ray\nemissions measured by the Fermi Large Area Telescope also show spatial\nvariations of the intensities and spectral indices of cosmic rays. These new\nobservations challenge the traditional simple acceleration and/or propagation\nscenario of Galactic cosmic rays. In this work we propose a spatially-dependent\ndiffusion scenario to explain all these phenomena. The diffusion coefficient is\nassumed to be anti-correlated with the source distribution, which is a natural\nexpectation from the charged particle transportation in turbulent magnetic\nfield. The spatially-dependent diffusion model also gives a lower level of\nanisotropies of cosmic rays, which are consistent with observations by\nunderground muons and air shower experiments. The spectral variations of cosmic\nrays across the Galaxy can be properly reproduced by this model.",

    "summary": "A recent study of 5 TeV $p$-Pb centrality combined a Glauber model of $p$-Pb\ncollision geometry with an assumption of linear scaling between $n_{ch}$\n(charge) integrated within some $\\eta$ acceptance and the number of nucleon\nparticipants $N_{part}$. The study concluded that $N_{part}$ increases to\nnearly 16 in central collisions, and the high-$p_t$ region of $p$-Pb $p_t$\nspectra rescaled by the Glauber-estimated number of $p$-N binary collisions\nremains consistent with a $p$-$p$ spectrum for the same energy, independent of\n$p$-Pb centrality. However, the relation between $N_{part}$ and $n_{ch}$\nderived from a two-component (soft + hard) model (TCM) study of ensemble-mean\n$\\bar p_t$ data for the same system is quite different. This article reports a\ndetailed analysis of the Glauber study and the question of centrality in $p$-A\ncollisions. The Glauber centrality model is compared with the $\\bar p_t$ TCM to\nunderstand the sources of major differences. The assumption of linear\nproportionality between $n_{ch}$ and $N_{part}$ is found to be inconsistent\nwith $\\bar p_t$ data. Properties of the convolution integral relating a\ndifferential cross section and hadron production model to an event distribution\non $n_{ch}$ are examined. An alternative differential-cross-section\ndistribution is inferred from charge-multiplicity data, and the upper limit on\n$N_{part}$ is estimated to be near 8. The TCM centrality model is then applied\nto $p_t$ spectrum ratios to predict results for $p$-Pb spectra. The spectrum\nTCM is tested with identified-pion spectra from 5 TeV $p$-Pb collisions and the\nresult is consistent with previous $p$-$p$ TCM results. A TCM prediction that\nthe spectrum ratio at high $p_t$ should increase to 14 for central $p$-Pb\ncollisions due to quadratic dependence of dijet production on $n_{ch}$ is\nconsistent with $\\bar p_t$ data from the same system.",

    "summary": "Recently many investigations have considered Majorana dark matter\nco-annihilating with bound states formed by a strongly interacting scalar\nfield. However only the gluon radiation contribution to bound state formation\nand dissociation, which at high temperatures is subleading to soft 2->2\nscatterings, has been included. Making use of a non-relativistic effective\ntheory framework and solving a plasma-modified Schrodinger equation, we address\nthe effect of soft 2->2 scatterings as well as the thermal dissociation of\nbound states.

    "summary": "The cosmic history before the BBN is highly determined by the physics that\noperates beyond the Standard Model (BSM) of particle physics and it is poorly\nconstrained observationally. Ongoing and future precision measurements of the\nCMB observables can provide us with significant information about the pre-BBN\nera and hence possibly test the cosmological predictions of different BSM\nscenarios. Supersymmetry is a particularly motivated BSM theory and it is often\nthe case that different superymmetry breaking schemes require different cosmic\nhistories with specific reheating temperatures or low entropy production in\norder to be cosmologically viable. In this paper we quantify the effects of the\npossible alternative cosmic histories on the $n_s$ and $r$ CMB observables\nassuming a generic non-thermal stage after cosmic inflation. We analyze TeV and\nespecially multi-TeV supersymmetry breaking schemes assuming the neutralino and\ngravitino dark matter scenarios. We complement our analysis considering the\nStarobinsky $R^2$ inflation model to exemplify the improved CMB predictions\nthat a unified description of the early universe cosmic evolution yields. Our\nanalysis underlines the importance of the CMB precision measurements that can\nbe viewed, to some extend, as complementary to the laboratory experimental\nsearches for supersymmetry or other BSM theories.",

For definiteness, we choose $A_4$ as the flavour\nsymmetry, subsequently broken to the residual symmetry $Z_2$ in the neutrino\nsector. We provide a general discussion on flavour structures of NSIs from\nhigher-dimensional operators ($d \\leqslant 8$) without inducing unnecessary\ntree-level 4-charged-fermion interactions. Both $A_4$- and $Z_2$-motivated NSI\ntextures are obtained. UV completions of higher-dimensional operators lead to\nextra experimental constraints on NSI textures. As a consequence, only a few\ntextures can maximally reach the percent level of the standard matter effect.\nWe study the implement of matter-effect NSIs in DUNE from phenomenological\npoint of view, and discover that DUNE can test $A_4$ with high statistics\nlevel. We also present exclusion limits of sum rules suggested by UV-complete\nmodels. DUNE has a better performance for off-diagonal elements than diagonal\nones.",

    "summary": "The minimal gauge group extension to the standard model (SM) by the local\n$U(1)_{B-L}$ (MBLSM) is well known as the minimal model to understand neutrino\nmass origins via the seesaw mechanism, following the gauge principle. This\n\"small\" symmetry also has deep implication to another big thing, dark matter\n(DM) stability. We demonstrate it in the framework of minimal dark matter\n(MDM), which aims at addressing two basic questions on DM, stability and the\nnature of interactions. However, stability and perturbativity may only allow\nthe fermionic quintuplet. The situation is very different in the MBLSM, which\nleaves the subgroup of $U(1)_{B-L}$, the matter parity $(-1)^{3(B-L)}$,\nunbroken; it is able to stabilize all of the weakly-interacting {MDM candidates\n} after assigning a proper $U(1)_{B-L}$ charge. For the candidates with nonzero\nhypercharge, the phenomenological challenge comes from realizing the inelastic\nDM scenario thus evading the very strict DM direct detention bounds. We present\ntwo approaches that can slightly split the CP-even and -odd parts of the\nneutral components: 1) using the dimension 5 operators, which works for the\n$U(1)_{B-L}$ spontaneously breaking at very high scale; 2) mixing with {other\nfields} having zero hypercharge, which instead works for a low $U(1)_{B-L}$\nbreaking scale.",

    "summary": "Asymmetric dark matter (ADM) is motivated by the similar cosmological mass\ndensities measured for ordinary and dark matter. We present a comprehensive\ntheory for ADM that addresses the mass density similarity, going beyond the\nusual ADM explanations of similar number densities. It features an explicit\nmatter-antimatter asymmetry generation mechanism, has one fully worked out\nthermal history and suggestions for other possibilities, and meets all\nphenomenological, cosmological and astrophysical constraints. Importantly, it\nincorporates a deep reason for why the dark matter mass scale is related to the\nproton mass, a key consideration in ADM models. Our starting point is the idea\nof mirror matter, which offers an explanation for dark matter by duplicating\nthe standard model with a dark sector related by a $Z_2$ parity symmetry.\nHowever, the dark sector need not manifest as a symmetric copy of the standard\nmodel in the present day. By utilising the mechanism of \"asymmetric symmetry\nbreaking\" with two Higgs doublets in each sector, we develop a model of ADM\nwhere the mirror symmetry is spontaneously broken, leading to an electroweak\nscale in the dark sector that is significantly larger than that of the visible\nsector. The weak sensitivity of the ordinary and dark QCD confinement scales to\ntheir respective electroweak scales leads to the necessary connection between\nthe dark matter and proton masses. The dark matter is composed of either dark\nneutrons or a mixture of dark neutrons and metastable dark hydrogen atoms.\nLepton asymmetries are generated by the $CP$-violating decays of heavy Majorana\nneutrinos in both sectors. These are then converted by sphaleron processes to\nproduce the observed ratio of visible to dark matter in the universe. The\ndynamics responsible for the kinetic decoupling of the two sectors emerges as\nan important issue that we only partially solve.",

    "summary": "In ordinary QCD with light, degenerate, fundamental flavors, $CP$ symmetry is\nspontaneously broken at $\\theta=\\pi$, and domain wall solutions connecting the\nvacua can be constructed in chiral perturbation theory. In some cases the\nbreaking of $CP$ saturates an 't Hooft anomaly, and anomaly inflow requires\nnontrivial massless excitations on the domain walls. Analogously, $CP$ can be\nspontaneously broken in supersymmetric QCD with light flavors and small soft\nbreaking parameters. We study $CP$ breaking and domain walls in softly broken\nSQCD with $N_f<N$ flavors. Relative to ordinary QCD, the supersymmetric case\ncontains an extra light field, the $\\eta^\\prime$, which has interesting effects\non the structure of the walls. Vanishing of the $CP$ anomaly is associated with\nthe existence of multiple domain wall trajectories through field space,\nincluding walls which support no nontrivial massless excitations. In cases with\nan anomaly such walls are forbidden, and their absence in the relevant SQCD\ntheories can be seen directly from the geometry of the low energy field space.\nIn the case $N_f=N-1$, multiple approximately-BPS walls connect the vacua.\nCorrections to their tensions can be computed at leading order in the soft\nbreaking parameters, producing a phase diagram for the stable wall trajectory.\nWe also comment on domain walls in the similar case of QCD with an adjoint and\nfundamental flavors, and on the impact of adding an axion in this theory.",

    "summary": "We provide a general classification of template operators, up to NLO, that\nappear in chiral perturbation theories based on the two flavour patterns of\nspontaneous symmetry breaking SU($N_F$)/Sp($N_F$) and SU($N_F$)/SO($N_F$). All\npossible explicit-breaking sources parametrised by spurions transforming in the\nfundamental and in the two-index representations of the flavour symmetry are\nincluded. While our general framework can be applied to any model of strong\ndynamics, we specialise to composite-Higgs models, where the main explicit\nbreaking sources are a current mass, the gauging of flavour symmetries, and the\nYukawa couplings (for the top). For the top, we consider both bilinear\ncouplings and linear ones a la partial compositeness. Our templates provide a\nbasis for lattice calculations in specific models. As a special example, we\nconsider the SU(4)/Sp(4)$\\cong$ SO(6)/SO(5) pattern which corresponds to the\nminimal fundamental composite-Higgs model. We further revisit issues related to\nthe misalignment of the vacuum. In particular, we shed light on the physical\nproperties of the singlet $\\eta$, showing that it cannot develop a vacuum\nexpectation value without explicit CP violation in the underlying theory.",

We develop a perturbation theory\nto calculate the induced electromagnetic current that appears in the Maxwell\nequations, based on Schwinger's proper-time method, and combine it with the\nso-called gradient expansion to handle the variation of external fields\nperturbatively. The crossed field, i.e., the long wavelength limit of the\nelectromagnetic wave is first considered. The eigenmodes and the refractive\nindices as the eigenvalues associated with the eigenmodes are computed\nnumerically for the probe photon propagating in some particular directions. In\nso doing, no limitation is imposed on the field strength and the photon energy\nunlike previous studies. It is shown that the real part of the refractive index\nbecomes less than unity for strong fields, the phenomenon that has been known\nto occur for high-energy probe photons. We then evaluate numerically the\nlowest-order corrections to the crossed-field resulting from the field\nvariations in space and time.

As a first step, we present the\ngluon-fusion and bottom-quark annihilation cross sections for $h_a$ for the\ngeneral case of arbitrary complex parameters, and we demonstrate that squark\neffects strongly depend on the phases of the complex parameters.

The method amounts to solving the renormalisation group equation\nfor the effective potential with the boundary conditions chosen on the\nhypersurface where quantum corrections vanish. This hypersurface is defined\nthrough a suitable choice of a field-dependent value for the renormalisation\nscale. The method can be applied to any order in perturbation theory and it is\na generalisation of the standard procedure valid for the one-field case. In our\nmethod, however, the choice of the renormalisation scale does not eliminate\nindividual logarithmic terms but rather the entire loop corrections to the\neffective potential. It allows us to evaluate the improved effective potential\nfor arbitrary values of the scalar fields using the tree-level potential with\nrunning coupling constants as long as they remain perturbative. This opens the\npossibility of studying various applications which require an analysis of\nmulti-field effective potentials across different energy scales. In particular,\nthe issue of stability of the scalar potential can be easily studied beyond\ntree-level.",

We show that, in a simple test case, the distribution is not\nsufficiently well described by the generalised extreme value function. We\npresent a new method, where the distribution of $T$-values under the null\nhypothesis when comparing two large samples can be found by scaling the\ndistribution found when comparing small samples drawn from the same population.\nThis method can then be used to quickly calculate the $p$-values associated\nwith the results of the test.",

    "summary": "For the search for electroweak particles in the Minimal Supersymmetric\nStandard Model (MSSM) as well as for future precision analyses of these\nparticles an accurate knowledge of their production and decay properties is\nmandatory. We review the evaluation of the cross sections for the chargino,\nneutralino and scalar lepton production at e+e- colliders in the MSSM with\ncomplex parameters (cMSSM). The evaluation is based on a full one-loop\ncalculation of the various production mechanisms, including soft and hard\nphoton radiation. The dependence of the chargino/neutralino/slepton cross\nsections on the relevant cMSSM parameters is analyzed numerically. We find\nsizable contributions to many production cross sections. They amount roughly +-\n15% of the tree-level results, but can go up to +-40% or higher in extreme\ncases. Also the complex phase dependence of the one-loop corrections was found\nnon-negligible. The full one-loop contributions are thus crucial for physics\nanalyses at a future linear e+e- collider such as the ILC or CLIC.",

Signal events were generated for pure $CP$-even,\npure $CP$-odd and mixed-$CP$ coupling scenarios. Standard Model (SM)\nbackgrounds were also considered. Angular distributions and asymmetries were\nstudied and found to be potentially good probes to the $CP$ nature of the\ncoupling, even after detector simulation and full event reconstruction using a\nkinematic fit. Expected limits to the $t\\bar th$ production cross-section times\nbranching ratio were obtained for a range of top quark Yukawa $CP$-mixing\nangles and for different integrated luminosities of the LHC.",

    "summary": "We examine the class of initial conditions which give rise to inflation. Our\nanalysis is carried out for several popular models including: Higgs inflation,\nStarobinsky inflation, chaotic inflation, axion monodromy inflation and\nnon-canonical inflation. In each case we determine the set of initial\nconditions which give rise to sufficient inflation, with at least $60$\ne-foldings. A phase-space analysis has been performed for each of these models\nand the effect of the initial inflationary energy scale on inflation has been\nstudied numerically. This paper discusses two scenarios of Higgs inflation: (i)\nthe Higgs is coupled to the scalar curvature, (ii) the Higgs Lagrangian\ncontains a non-canonical kinetic term. In both cases we find Higgs inflation to\nbe very robust since it can arise for a large class of initial conditions. One\nof the central results of our analysis is that, for plateau-like potentials\nassociated with the Higgs and Starobinsky models, inflation can be realized\neven for initial scalar field values which lie close to the minimum of the\npotential. This dispels a misconception relating to plateau potentials\nprevailing in the literature. We also find that inflation in all models is more\nrobust for larger values of the initial energy scale.",

    "summary": "We present a Bayesian analysis of the combination of current neutrino\noscillation, neutrinoless double beta decay and CMB observations. Our major\ngoal is to carefully investigate the possibility to single out one neutrino\nmass ordering, Normal Ordering or Inverted Ordering, with current data. Two\npossible parametrizations (three neutrino masses versus the lightest neutrino\nmass plus the two oscillation mass splittings) and priors (linear versus\nlogarithmic) are examined. We find that the preference for NO is only driven by\nneutrino oscillation data. Moreover, the values of the Bayes factor indicate\nthat the evidence for NO is strong only when the scan is performed over the\nthree neutrino masses with logarithmic priors; for every other combination of\nparameterization and prior, the preference for NO is only weak. As a by-product\nof our Bayesian analyses, we are able to a) compare the Bayesian bounds on the\nneutrino mixing parameters to those obtained by means of frequentist\napproaches, finding a very good agreement; b) determine that the lightest\nneutrino mass plus the two mass splittings parametrization, motivated by the\nphysical observables, is strongly preferred over the three neutrino mass\neigenstates scan and c) find that there is a weak-to-moderate preference for\nlogarithmic priors. These results establish the optimal strategy to\nsuccessfully explore the neutrino parameter space, based on the use of the\noscillation mass splittings and a logarithmic prior on the lightest neutrino\nmass. We also show that the limits on the total neutrino mass $\\sum m_\\nu$ can\nchange dramatically when moving from one prior to the other. These results have\nprofound implications for future studies on the neutrino mass ordering, as they\ncrucially state the need for self-consistent analyses which explore the best\nparametrization and priors, without combining results that involve different\nassumptions.",

Mass loss outside of the tidal radius forces the core to relax into a\nless compact configuration, lowering the tidal radius. As the characteristic\nradius of a solitonic core scales inversely with its mass, tidal stripping\nresults in a runaway effect and rapid tidal disruption of the core once its\ncentral density drops below $4.5$ times the average density of the host within\nthe orbital radius. Additionally, we find that the core is deformed into a\ntidally locked ellipsoid with increasing eccentricities until it is completely\ndisrupted. Using the core mass loss rate, we compute the minimum mass of cores\nthat can survive several orbits for different FDM particle masses and compare\nit with observed masses of satellite galaxies in the Milky Way.",

    "summary": "Neutron production in lead by cosmic muons has been studied with a Gadolinium\ndoped liquid scintillator detector installed in the T\\\"ubingen shallow\nunderground laboratory, next to the Muon-Induced Neutron Indirect Detection\nEXperiment used for muon tagging. The neutrons were detected through neutron\ncapture signals and neutron-induced nuclear recoil signals. Results on the\nrates of observed neutron captures and nuclear recoils are presented and\ncompared to predictions from GEANT4-9.6 and GEANT4.10.3. The predicted rates\nare significantly too low for both versions of GEANT4. For neutron capture\nevents, the observation exceeds the predictions by factors of $\n1.65~\\pm\\,0.02\\,\\textrm{(stat.)}~\\pm\\,0.07\\,\\textrm{(syst.)} $ and $\n2.58~\\pm\\,0.03\\,\\textrm{(stat.)}~\\pm\\,0.11\\,\\textrm{(syst.)} $ for GEANT4-9.6\nand GEANT4-10.3, respectively. For neutron nuclear recoil events, which require\nneutron energies above approximately 5 MeV, the factors are even larger, $\n2.22~\\pm\\,0.05\\,\\textrm{(stat.)}~\\pm\\,0.25\\,\\textrm{(syst.)} $ and $\n3.76~\\pm\\,0.09\\,\\textrm{(stat.)}~\\pm\\,0.41\\,\\textrm{(syst.)} $, respectively.\nAlso presented is the first statistically significant measurement of the\nspectrum of neutrons induced by cosmic muons in lead between 5 and 40\\,MeV. It\nwas obtained by unfolding the nuclear recoil spectrum. The observed neutron\nspectrum is harder than the GEANT4 predicted spectra. An investigation of the\ndistribution of the time difference between muon tags and nuclear recoil\nsignals confirms the validity of the unfolding procedure and shows that GEANT4\ncannot properly describe the time distribution of nuclear recoil events. In\ngeneral, the description of the data is worse for GEANT4-10.3 than for\nGEANT4-9.6.",

The $B \\to K^*$ transition form\nfactors (TFFs) are key components of the decay. To achieve a more accurate QCD\nprediction, we adopt a chiral correlator for calculating the QCD light-cone sum\nrules for those TFFs with the purpose of suppressing the uncertain high-twist\ndistribution amplitudes. Our predictions show that the asymmetries under the\nStandard Model and the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model with minimal\nflavor violation are close in shape for $q^2 \\ge 6~{\\rm GeV}^2$ and are\nconsistent with the Belle, LHCb and CDF data within errors. When $q^2 < 2~{\\rm\nGeV}^2$, their predictions behave quite differently. Thus a careful study on\nthe $B \\to K^* \\mu^+ \\mu^-$ decay within small $q^2$-region could be helpful\nfor searching new physics beyond the Standard Model. As a further application,\nwe also apply the $B \\to K^*$ TFFs to the branching ratio and longitudinal\npolarization fraction of the $B\\to K^*\\nu\\bar\\nu$ decay within different\nmodels.",

One involves aspects of the non-Abelian\ncharacter of Quantum Chromodynamics that are expressed in the strong running\ncoupling and generate tight, dynamical color-antitriplet quark-quark\ncorrelations in the scalar-isoscalar and pseudovector-isotriplet channels. This\nattraction is magnified by quark exchange associated with diquark breakup and\nreformation, which is required in order to ensure that each valence-quark\nparticipates in all diquark correlations to the complete extent allowed by its\nquantum numbers. Combining these effects, we arrive at a properly\nantisymmetrised Faddeev wave function for the nucleon and calculate, e.g. the\nflavor-separated versions of the Dirac and Pauli form factors and the proton's\nleading-twist parton distribution amplitude. We conclude that available data\nand planned experiments are capable of validating the proposed picture.",

    "summary": "In order to explore the possible physical quantities for judging different\nstructures of the newly observed resonance $d^*(2380)$, we study its\nelectromagnetic form factors. In addition to the electric charge monopole $C0$,\nwe calculate its electric quadrupole $E2$, magnetic dipole $M1$, and six-pole\n$M3$ form factors on the base of the realistic coupled $\\Delta\\Delta+CC$\nchannel $d^*$ wave function with both the $S$- and $D$-partial waves. The\nresults show that the magnetic dipole moment and electric quadrupole\ndeformation of $d^*$ are 7.602 and $2.53\\times 10^{-2}~\\rm{fm}^2$,\nrespectively. The calculated magnetic dipole moment in the naive constituent\nquark model is also compared with the result of $D_{12}\\pi$ picture. By\ncomparing with partial results where the $d^*$ state is considered with a\nsingle $\\Delta\\Delta$ and with a $D_{12}\\pi$ structures, we find that in\naddition to the charge distribution of $d^*(2380)$, the magnetic dipole moment\nand magnetic radius can be used to discriminate different structures of $d^*$.\nMoreover, a quite small electric quadrupole deformation indicates that $d^*$ is\nmore inclined to an slightly oblate shape due to our compact hexaquark\ndominated structure of $d^*(2380)$.",

    "summary": "Using effective field theoretical methods, we show that besides the already\nobserved gravitational waves, quantum gravity predicts two further massive\nclassical fields leading to two new massive waves. We set a limit on the masses\nof these new modes using data from the E\\\"ot-Wash experiment. We point out that\nthe existence of these new states is a model independent prediction of quantum\ngravity. We then explain how these new classical fields could impact\nastrophysical processes and in particular the binary inspirals of neutron stars\nor black holes. We calculate the emission rate of these new states in binary\ninspirals astrophysical processes.",

    "summary": "This work explores the possibility of obtaining a mass gap in Yang-Mills\ntheories via the intrinsic gauge bosons, without invoking a separate Higgs\nboson or fermion-antifermion pairs. Instead, pairs of gauge bosons in the spin\nand isospin singlet state form a pair of composite Higgs bosons which can be\nviewed as the simplest possible glueball of Yang-Mills gauge theories.\nQuadratic and quartic gauge boson self-interactions form a potential that leads\nto a finite expectation value of the gauge boson amplitude. Transverse\npolarization ensures Lorentz invariance of the vacuum after averaging over all\npossible polarization vectors. But the scalar pair products exhibit a finite\nvacuum expectation value which breaks the gauge symmetry dynamically.\nCompatibility with the standard Higgs potential determines the quadratic and\nquartic coupling constants.",

    "summary": "FCNC top decays are very strongly suppressed in the Standard Model and the\nobservation of any such decay would be a direct signature of physics beyond SM.\nMany \"new physics\" scenarios predict contributions to FCNC processes and the\nlargest enhancement in many models is for t$\\rightarrow$cH decay. Enhancements\nfor the decay channel t$\\rightarrow$c$\\gamma$ are more modest, but the decay\nstill has a clearly identifiable kinematic signature. Prospects for measuring\nthese decays at CLIC running at 380 GeV were studied with full detector\nsimulation, taking the luminosity distribution, beam polarization and beam\ninduced background into account. Top pair production events with\nt$\\rightarrow$cH decays can be identified based on the kinematic constraints\nand flavour tagging information. The analysis was divided into three steps:\nclassification of top pair candidate events, event quality determination and\nkinematic reconstruction based on signal or background hypotheses, and final\nseparation of signal from background. To obtain optimal results, selection\ncriteria based on the dedicated Boosted Decision Trees (BDT) were used at each\nstep. The expected limit on BR(t$\\rightarrow$cH)$\\times$BR(H$\\rightarrow\nb\\bar{b}$) from a combined analysis of hadronic and semi-leptonic top pair\nsamples, as well as the limit on BR(t$\\rightarrow$c$\\gamma$) from hadronic top\npair decays are presented.",

This transition involves\nbeyond standard model theories that predict the violation of the lepton number\nconservation by two units. There is no experimental confirmation yet for this\ndecay, but new experiments have set lower-limits for the associated half-lives\nin the case of several isotopes. Using an effective field theory that describes\nthis transition, we calculate half-life ratios for five experimentally\ninteresting isotopes in the case of 12 lepton number violating couplings. These\nhalf-life ratios can be used to probe the sensitivity of the five isotopes in\nrelation to their respective mechanisms, to predict the half-life limits needed\nto match the different experimental results, and in the case of experimental\nconfirmation, these ratios could possibly indicate the dominant mechanism of\nthe transition. We provide an analysis that could reveal valuable information\nregarding the dominant neutrinoless double-beta decay mechanism, if\nexperimental half-life data becomes available for different isotopes.",

The interaction results in emission of a number of\nfragments as a consequence of electromagnetic dissociation of the excited\ntarget nuclei. This excitation is attributed to absorption of photons by the\ntarget nuclei due to the intense electric field of the very fast incident muon\nparticles. The interactions take place at impact parameters that allows\nultra-peripheral collisions to take place, leading to giant resonances and\nhence multi-fragmentation of emulsion targets.

    "summary": "The STAR collaboration has observed an excess production of $e^+e^-$ pairs in\nrelativistic heavy ion collisions, over the expectations from hadronic\nproduction models. The excess pairs have transverse momenta $p_T < 150\\ {\\rm\nMeV}/c$ and are most prominent in peripheral gold-gold and uranium-uranium\ncollisions. The pairs exhibit a peak at the $J/\\psi$ mass, but include a wide\ncontinuum, with pair invariant masses from 400 MeV/c$^2$ up to 2.6 GeV/c$^2$.\nThe ALICE Collaboration observes a similar excess in peripheral lead-lead\ncollisions, but only at the $J/\\psi$ mass, without a corresponding continuum.\n  This paper presents a calculation of the cross-section and kinematic for\ntwo-photon production of $e^+e^-$ pairs, and find general agreement with the\nSTAR data. The calculation is based on the STARlight simulation code, which is\nbased on the Weizs\\\"acker-Williams virtual photon approach. The STAR continuum\nobservations are compatible with two-photon production of $e^+e^-$ pairs. The\nALICE analysis required individual muon $p_T$ be greater than 1 GeV/c; this\neliminated almost all of the pairs from two-photon interactions, while leaving\nmost of the $J/\\psi$ decays.",

    "summary": "Gravitational waves (GWs) have a great potential to probe cosmology. We\nreview early universe sources that can lead to cosmological backgrounds of GWs.\nWe begin by presenting definitions of GWs in flat space-time and in a\ncosmological setting, and discussing the reasons why GW backgrounds from the\nearly universe are of a stochastic nature. We recap current observational\nconstraints on stochastic backgrounds, and discuss some of the characteristics\nof present and future GW detectors including advanced LIGO, advanced Virgo, the\nEinstein Telescope, KAGRA, LISA. We then review in detail early universe GW\ngeneration mechanisms proposed in the literature, as well as the properties of\nthe GW backgrounds they give rise to. We classify the backgrounds in five\ncategories: GWs from quantum vacuum fluctuations during standard slow-roll\ninflation, GWs from processes that operate within extensions of the standard\ninflationary paradigm, GWs from post-inflationary preheating and related\nnon-perturbative phenomena, GWs from first order phase transitions (related or\nnot to the electroweak symmetry breaking), and GWs from topological defects, in\nparticular from cosmic strings. The phenomenology of early universe processes\nthat can generate a stochastic background of GWs is extremely rich, and some\nbackgrounds are within the reach of near-future GW detectors. A future\ndetection of any of these backgrounds will provide crucial information on the\nunderlying high energy theory describing the early universe, probing energy\nscales well beyond the reach of particle accelerators.",

Such\nleptoquarks are mainly searched via the decays into first two generations at\nthe LHC and also recent studies have looked into their third generation decays\nto obtain the corresponding mass bounds. The indirect searches stringently\nconstrain the leptoquark to decay into first generation. Hence studies for\nleptoquark, involving decays in both second and third generations are\nimportant. In the article, we mainly study the decays of leptoquark into second\nand third generations via $c\\,\\mu, t\\, \\tau$ decay modes. We perform a PYTHIA\nbased simulation considering all the dominant SM backgrounds at the LHC with\n14\\,TeV center of mass energy. Limits have been calculated for the leptoquark\nmass that can be probed at the LHC with an integrated luminosity of 3000\nfb$^{-1}$. The leptoquark mass reconstructed from its decay products into third\ngeneration, has the maximum reach. However, $\\mu + c$ channel, comprising of a\nvery hard muon and $c$-jet produces a much cleaner mass peak. Single leptoquark\nproduction in association with a $\\mu$ or $\\nu_\\tau$ provide some unique\nsignatures that can also be probed at the LHC.",

    "summary": "We briefly review several activities at Mainz related to hadronic\nlight-by-light scattering (HLbL) using lattice QCD. First we present a\nposition-space approach to the HLbL contribution in the muon g-2, where we\nfocus on exploratory studies of the pion-pole contribution in a simple model\nand the lepton loop in QED in the continuum and in infinite volume. The second\npart describes a lattice calculation of the double-virtual pion transition form\nfactor F_{pi^0 gamma^* gamma^*}(q_1^2, q_2^2) in the spacelike region with\nphoton virtualities up to 1.5 GeV^2 which paves the way for a lattice\ncalculation of the pion-pole contribution to HLbL. The third topic involves\nHLbL forward scattering amplitudes calculated in lattice QCD which can be\ndescribed, using dispersion relations (HLbL sum rules), by gamma^* gamma^* ->\nhadrons fusion cross sections and then compared with phenomenological models.",

    "summary": "The sensitivity of beam dump experiments to heavy neutral leptons depends on\nthe relative strength of their couplings to individual lepton flavours in the\nStandard Model. We study the impact of present neutrino oscillation data on\nthese couplings in the minimal type I seesaw model and find that it\nsignificantly constrains the allowed heavy neutrino flavour mixing patterns. We\nestimate the effect that the DUNE experiment will have on these predictions. We\nthen discuss implication that this has for the sensitivity of the NA62\nexperiment when operated in the beam dump mode and provide sensitivity\nestimates for different benchmark scenarios. We find that the sensitivity can\nvary by almost two orders of magnitude for general choices of the model\nparameters, but depends only weakly on the flavour mixing pattern within the\nparameter range that is preferred by neutrino oscillation data.",

    "summary": "We introduce the spiked monopole, which is a 't Hooft-Polyakov monopole with\ntwo charged scalar Higgs fields, of which one enjoys a quartic\nself-interaction. The free Higgs field behaves as in a BPS monopole, reducing\nthe inter-monopole repulsion. The other Higgs has a spiked profile similar to a\nnon-BPS monopole. Using the methods from numerical relativity recently adapted\nto the Yang-Mills-Higgs theory by Vachaspati, we simulate the interactions of\nsuch monopoles. During the long lifetime of these simulations the individual\nmonopoles are stable. We find that they are always repulsive, with a small\nrepulsion only when the interaction Higgs VEV is proportionately small. We\nbriefly comment on implications for giant monopole dark matter models and on\nsupermassive black hole seeding by the spikes.",

It was found that\nchanging the beam parameters would increase the luminosity and therefore\nfurther strengthen the physics outcome. On the downside, the new beam\nparameters lead to an increase in the detector background arising from\nbeam-beam interactions. The simulation study, which is the topic of this note,\nfocuses on the impact the increased background levels have on the SiD vertex\ndetector performance. The results suggest that the vertex detector occupancies\ncan be accommodated in the design of the SiD detector without any loss in\nperformance.",

    "summary": "The identity of Dark Matter (DM) is one of the most captivating topics in\nparticle physics today. The R-parity conserving Minimal Supersymmetric Standard\nModel (MSSM), which naturally provides a DM candidate in the form of the\nlightest neutralino ($\\tilde{\\chi}_{1}^{0}$), is used as a benchmark scenario\nto show that a measurement of $\\Omega_{\\tilde{\\chi}_{1}^{0}}h^{2}$ can be\nachieved from measurements at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. Focus is placed\non compressed mass spectra regions, where the mass difference between the\n$\\tilde{\\chi}_{1}^{0}$ and the $\\tilde{\\tau}_{1}$ is small and where the\n$\\tilde{\\tau}_{1}$-$\\tilde{\\chi}_{1}^{0}$ coannihilation (CA) mechanism of the\nearly Universe plays an important role. The technique for measuring\n$\\Omega_{\\tilde{\\chi}_{1}^{0}}h^{2}$ relies on two proposed searches for\ncompressed Supersymmetry (SUSY): 1) production via Vector Boson Fusion (VBF)\nprocesses; and 2) production with associated energetic jets from initial state\nradiation (ISR). These approaches allow for the determination of the relic\nabundance at the LHC for any model where CA is an important DM reduction\nmechanism in the early Universe. Thus, it is possible to confirm that the DM we\nobserve today were $\\tilde{\\chi}_{1}^{0}$'s created in the early Universe. We\nshow that from measurements in the VBF and ISR SUSY searches at the LHC, the\ndark matter relic density can be measured with an uncertainty of 25\\% with 3000\nfb$^{-1}$ of 13 TeV proton-proton data.",

    "summary": "A statistical combination of several searches for the electroweak production\nof charginos and neutralinos is presented. All searches use proton-proton\ncollision data at $\\sqrt{s}=$ 13 TeV, recorded with the CMS detector at the LHC\nin 2016 and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb$^{-1}$. In\naddition to the combination of previous searches, a targeted analysis requiring\nthree or more charged leptons (electrons or muons) is presented, focusing on\nthe challenging scenario in which the difference in mass between the two least\nmassive neutralinos is approximately equal to the mass of the Z boson. The\nresults are interpreted in simplified models of chargino-neutralino or\nneutralino pair production. For chargino-neutralino production, in the case\nwhen the lightest neutralino is massless, the combination yields an observed\n(expected) limit at the 95% confidence level on the chargino mass of up to 650\n(570) GeV, improving upon the individual analysis limits by up to 40 GeV. If\nthe mass difference between the two least massive neutralinos is approximately\nequal to the mass of the Z boson in the chargino-neutralino model, the targeted\nsearch requiring three or more leptons obtains observed and expected exclusion\nlimits of around 225 GeV on the second neutralino mass and 125 GeV on the\nlightest neutralino mass, improving the observed limit by about 60 GeV in both\nmasses compared to the previous CMS result. In the neutralino pair production\nmodel, the combined observed (expected) exclusion limit on the neutralino mass\nextends up to 650-750 (550-750) GeV, depending on the branching fraction\nassumed. This extends the observed exclusion achieved in the individual\nanalyses by up to 200 GeV. The combined result additionally excludes some\nintermediate gaps in the mass coverage of the individual analyses.",

Specifically we\nconsider three generators: one that implements NLO corrections in the\nproduction dynamics, one that includes also NLO corrections in top decay in the\nnarrow width approximation, and one that implements NLO corrections for both\nproduction and decay including finite-width and interference effects. Our aim\nis to provide an assessment of the uncertainties of purely theoretical origin,\nwe thus consider simplified top-mass related observables that are broadly\nrelated to those effectively used by experiments, eventually modelling\nexperimental resolution effects with simple smearing procedures. Examining\nthese observables with generators of increasing accuracy allows us to assess\nthe theoretical errors due to the use of the less accurate generators.\nFurthermore, we estimate theoretical uncertainties associated with the\nvariation of scales and with the choice of parton distribution functions. In\norder to give an indicative assessment of the uncertainties due to the shower\nand to the modelling of non-perturbative effects, we interface our NLO+PS\ngenerators to both Pythia8.2 and Herwig7.1, with various settings, and compare\nthe results.",

    "summary": "A predictive Leptogenesis scenario is presented based on the Minimal Lepton\nFlavour Violation symmetry. In the realisation with three right-handed\nneutrinos transforming under the same flavour symmetry of the lepton\nelectroweak doublets, lepton masses and PMNS mixing parameters can be described\naccording to the current data, including a large Dirac CP phase. The observed\nmatter-antimatter asymmetry of the Universe can be achieved through\nLeptogenesis, with the CP asymmetry parameter $\\varepsilon$ described in terms\nof only lepton masses, mixings and phases, plus two real parameters of the\nlow-energy effective description. This is in contrast with the large majority\nof models present in the literature, where $\\varepsilon$ depends on several\nhigh-energy parameters, preventing a direct connection between low-energy\nobservables and the baryon to photon ratio today. Recovering the correct amount\nof baryon asymmetry in the Universe constrains the Majorana phases of the PMNS\nmatrix within specific ranges of values: clear predictions for the neutrinoless\ndouble beta decay emerge, representing a potential smoking gun for this\nframework.",

It is\ntempting to speculate that there is an anthropic reason behind this\nnear-criticality. We show how an axionic field can provide a landscape of\nvacuum states in which $\\lambda$ scans. These states are populated during\ninflation to create a multiverse with different quartic couplings, with a\nprobability distribution $P$ that can be computed. If $P$ is peaked in the\nanthropically forbidden region of Higgs instability, then the most probable\nuniverse compatible with observers would be close to the boundary, as observed.\nWe discuss three scenarios depending on the Higgs vacuum selection mechanism:\ndecay by quantum tunneling; by thermal fluctuations or by inflationary\nfluctuations.",

Using the operator product\nexpansion we prove the large-momentum factorization of the quasi-parton\ndistribution function in LaMET, and show that the more recently discussed\nIoffe-time distribution approach also obeys an equivalent factorization\ntheorem.

We\ndiscuss the diffractive mechanism calculated within the tensor-pomeron approach\nincluding both pomeron and reggeon exchanges. The theoretical results are\ncompared with existing WA102 and ISR experimental data and predictions for\nplanned or current experiments at RHIC and the LHC are presented. The\ndistribution in ${\\rm y}_{diff}$, the rapidity distance between proton and\nantiproton, is particularly interesting. We find a dip at ${\\rm y}_{diff} = 0$\nfor the $p \\bar{p}$ production, in contrast to the $\\pi^{+}\\pi^{-}$ and\n$K^{+}K^{-}$ production. We predict also the $p \\bar{p}$ invariant mass\ndistribution to be less steep than for the pseudoscalar dimeson pairs. We argue\nthat these specific differences for the $p \\bar{p}$ production with respect to\nthe pseudoscalar meson pair production can be attributed to the proper\ntreatment of the spin of produced particles. We discuss asymmetries which are\ndue to interference of $C=+1$ and $C=-1$ amplitudes of $p \\bar{p}$ production.\nWe have also calculated the cross section for the $pp \\to pp \\Lambda\n\\overline{\\Lambda}$ reaction. Here, the cross section is smaller but the\ncharacteristic feature for $d\\sigma/d{\\rm y}_{diff}$ is predicted to be similar\nto $p \\bar{p}$ production.

    "summary": "We report the first measurement of monoenergetic muon neutrino charged\ncurrent interactions. MiniBooNE has isolated 236 MeV muon neutrino events\noriginating from charged kaon decay at rest ($K^+ \\rightarrow \\mu^+ \\nu_\\mu$)\nat the NuMI beamline absorber. These signal $\\nu_\\mu$-carbon events are\ndistinguished from primarily pion decay in flight $\\nu_\\mu$ and\n$\\overline{\\nu}_\\mu$ backgrounds produced at the target station and decay pipe\nusing their arrival time and reconstructed muon energy. The significance of the\nsignal observation is at the 3.9$\\sigma$ level. The muon kinetic energy,\nneutrino-nucleus energy transfer ($\\omega=E_\\nu-E_\\mu$), and total cross\nsection for these events is extracted.

    "summary": "We describe a new method for the automated construction of one-loop\namplitudes based on the open-loop algorithm, where various operations are\nperformed on-the-fly while constructing the integrand. In particular, an\non-the-fly reduction interleaved with the construction steps of the amplitude\nkeeps the maximum tensor rank in the loop momentum at two throughout the\nalgorithm, thus drastically reducing the complexity of the calculation. The\nfull reduction to scalar integrals is unified with the amplitude construction\nin a single recursion within the OpenLoops framework. This approach strongly\nexploits the factorisation of one-loop integrands in a product of loop\nsegments. The on-the-fly approach, which is also applied to helicity summation\nand the merging of different diagrams, increases the speed of the original\nopen-loop algorithm in a very significant way. A remarkably high level of\nnumerical stability is achieved by exploiting freedoms in reduction identities\nand through simple expansions in rank-two Gram determinants. These features are\nparticularly attractive for NLO multi-leg and NNLO real-virtual calculations.\nThe new algorithm will be made public in a forthcoming release of the OpenLoops\nprogram.",

    "summary": "Spherically symmetric relativistic stars with the polytropic equation of\nstate (EoS), which possess the local pressure anisotropy, are considered within\nthe framework of general relativity. The generalized Lane-Emden equations are\nderived for the arbitrary anisotropy parameter $\\Delta=p_t-p_r$ ($p_t$ and\n$p_r$ being the transverse and radial pressure, respectively). They are then\napplied to some special ansatz for the anisotropy parameter in the form of the\ndifferential relation between the anisotropy parameter $\\Delta$ and the metric\nfunction $\\nu$. The analytical solutions of the obtained equations are found\nfor incompressible fluid stars and then used for getting their mass-radius\nrelation, gravitational and binding energy. Also, following the Chandrasekhar\nvariational approach, the dynamical stability of incompressible anisotropic\nfluid stars with the polytropic EoS against radial oscillations is studied. It\nis shown that the local pressure anisotropy with $p_t>p_r$ can make the\nincompressible fluid stars unstable with respect to radial oscillations, in\ncontrast to incompressible isotropic fluid stars with the polytropic EoS which\nare dynamically stable.",

Given their large parameter space, defined by the\ncombinations of sterile neutrino mass $m_{\\nu}$ and mixing parameter\n$\\sin^2(2\\theta)$ with active neutrinos, we focus on models with $m_{\\nu}=7$\nkeV, consistent with the tentative 3.5 keV line detected in several X-ray\nspectra of clusters and galaxies. We consider i) two resonant production models\nwith $\\sin^2(2\\theta)=5\\,10^{-11}$ and $\\sin^2(2\\theta)=2\\,10^{-10}$, to cover\nthe range of mixing parameter consistent with the 3.5 keV line; ii) two\nscalar-decay models, representative of the two possible cases characterizing\nsuch a scenario: a freeze-in and a freeze-out case. We also consider thermal\nWarm Dark Matter with particle mass $m_X=3$ keV. Using a semi-analytic model,\nwe compare the predictions for the different DM scenarios with a wide set of\nobservables. We find that comparing the predicted evolution of the stellar mass\nfunction, the abundance of satellites of Milky Way-like galaxies, and the\nglobal star formation history of galaxies with observations does not allow to\ndisentangle the effects of the baryonic physics from those related to the\ndifferent DM models. On the other hand, the distribution of the stellar-to-halo\nmass ratios, the abundance of faint galaxies in the UV luminosity function at\n$z\\gtrsim 6$, and the specific star formation and age distribution of local,\nlow-mass galaxies constitute potential probes for the considered DM scenarios.\nWe discuss how next observations with upcoming facilities will enable to rule\nout or to strongly support DM models based on sterile neutrinos.",

    "summary": "Recently there has been significant interest in understanding the macroscopic\nquantum transport in a many-body system of chiral fermions. A natural many-body\nframework for describing such a system which is generally out of equilibrium,\nis the transport equation for its phase space distribution function. There are\nhowever several subtle and confusing issues, particularly related to Lorentz\ninvariance and frame dependence. In this paper, we derive a covariant form of\nchiral transport equation for massless fermions, by starting from the general\nWigner function formalism and carrying out a complete and consistent\nsemiclassical expansion up to $\\hat{\\mathbf{O}}(\\hbar)$ order. This new result\nclarifies the Lorentz invariance and frame dependence issues associated with\nthe $\\hat{\\mathbf{O}}(\\hbar)$ correction. From the so-obtained chiral transport\nequation one also naturally derives as its consequences the 3D formulation of\nchiral kinetic theory as well as many peculiar phenomena of chiral fermions.",

    "summary": "We study the possibility to observe sterile neutrinos with masses in the\nrange between 5 GeV and 20 GeV at the LHC, using the exclusive semileptonic\nmodes involving pions, namely W to lepton + N to n pions + lepton+lepton (n =\n1, 2, 3). The two pion and three pion modes require extrapolations of form\nfactors to large time-like $q^2$, which we do using vector dominance models as\nwell as light front holographic QCD, with remarkable agreement. This mass\nregion is difficult to explore with inclusive dilepton+dijet modes or trilepton\nmodes and impossible to explore in rare meson decays. While particle\nidentification is a real challenge in these modes, vertex displacement due to\nthe long living neutrino in the above mass range can greatly help reduce\nbackgrounds. Assuming a sample of $10^9$ W bosons at the end of the LHC Run 2,\nthese modes could discover a sterile neutrino in the above mass range or\nimprove the current bounds on the heavy-to-light lepton mixings by an order of\nmagnitude, $U_{l N}^2 \\sim 2 \\times 10^{-6}$. Moreover, by studying the equal\nsign and opposite sign dileptons, the Majorana or Dirac character of the\nsterile neutrino may be revealed.",

    "summary": "We report experimental evidence at the 2.5$\\sigma$ level for an unexpected\nsignal associated with the GW170817 binary neutron star inspiral. This evidence\nderives from a laboratory experiment simultaneously measuring the $\\beta$-decay\nrates of Si-32 and Cl-36 in a common detector. Whereas the Si-32 and Cl-36\ndecay rates show no statistical correlation before or after the inspiral, they\nare highly correlated ($\\sim 95\\%$) in the 5 hour time interval immediately\nfollowing the inspiral. If we interpret this correlation as arising from the\ninfluence of particles emitted during the inspiral, then we can estimate the\nmass $m_{x}$ of these particles from the time delay between the gravity-wave\nsignal and a peak in the $\\beta$-decay data. We find for particles of energy 10\nMeV, $m_{x}$ $\\lesssim$ 16 eV which includes the neutrino mass region $m_{\\nu}$\n$\\lesssim$ 2 eV. The latter is based on existing limits for the masses $m_{i}$\nof the three known neutrino flavors. Additionally, we find that the correlation\nis even stronger if we include data in the 80 minute period before the arrival\nof the gravity wave signal. Given the large number of radionuclides whose\ndecays are being monitored at any given time, we conjecture that other groups\nmay also be in a position to search for statistically suggestive fluctuations\nof radionuclide decay rates associated with the GW170817 inspiral.",

    "summary": "Recently, Belle Collaboration has reported the measurement of the\nspin-flipping transition $\\Upsilon(4S) \\to h_b(1P)\\eta$ with an unexpectedly\nlarge branching ratio: $\\mathcal{B}(\\Upsilon(4S) \\to h_b(1P)\\eta) =(2.18\\pm\n0.11\\pm 0.18)\\times 10^{-3}$. Such a large branching fraction contradicts with\nthe anticipated suppression for the spin flip. In this work, we examine the\neffects induced by intermediate bottomed meson loops and point out that these\neffects are significantly important. Using the effective Lagrangian approach\n(ELA), we find the experimental data on $\\Upsilon(4S) \\to h_b(1P)\\eta$ can be\naccommodated with the reasonable inputs. We then explore the decays\n$\\Upsilon(5S,6S)\\to h_b(1P)\\eta$ and find that these two channels also have\nsizable branching fractions. We also calculate these these processes in the\nframework of nonrelativistic effective field theory (NREFT). For the decays\n$\\Upsilon(4S) \\to h_b(1P) \\eta$, the NREFT results are at the same order of\nmagnitude but smaller than the ELA results by a factor of $2$ to $5$. For the\ndecays $\\Upsilon(5S, 6S) \\to h_b(1P) \\eta$ the NREFT results are smaller than\nthe ELA results by approximately one order of magnitude.

    "summary": "We present a major upgrade of the micrOMEGAs dark matter code to compute the\nabundance of feebly interacting dark matter candidates through the freeze-in\nmechanism in generic extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics. We\ndevelop the necessary formalism in order to solve the freeze-in Boltzmann\nequations while making as few simplifying assumptions as possible concerning\nthe phase-space distributions of the particles involved in the dark matter\nproduction process. We further show that this formalism allows us to treat\ndifferent freeze-in scenarios and discuss the way it is implemented in the\ncode. We find that, depending on the New Physics scenario under consideration,\nthe effect of a proper treatment of statistics on the predicted dark matter\nabundance can range from a few percent up to a factor of two, or more. We\nmoreover illustrate the underlying physics, as well as the various novel\nfunctionalities of micrOMEGAs, by presenting several example results obtained\nfor different dark matter models.",

    "summary": "Despite extensive searches for an additional neutral massive gauge boson at\nthe LHC, a $Z^\\prime$ at the weak scale could still be present if its couplings\nto the first two generations of quarks are suppressed, in which case the\nproduction in hadron colliders relies on tree-level processes in association\nwith heavy flavors or one-loop processes in association with a jet. We consider\nthe low-energy effective theory of a top-philic $Z'$ and present possible UV\ncompletions. We clarify theoretical subtleties in evaluating the production of\na top-philic $Z'$ at the LHC and examine carefully the treatment of an\nanomalous $Z'$ current in the low-energy effective theory. Recipes for properly\ncomputing the production rate in the $Z'+j$ channel are given. We discuss\nconstraints from colliders and low-energy probes of new physics. As an\napplication, we apply these considerations to models that use a weak-scale $Z'$\nto explain possible violations of lepton universality in $B$ meson decays, and\nshow that the future running of a high luminosity LHC can potentially cover\nmuch of the remaining parameter space favored by this particular interpretation\nof the $B$ physics anomaly.",

    "summary": "Superstring theories are very promising theoretically, but the enormous\nlandscape of string vacua and the (likely) very large underlying string scale\nimply that they may never be tested directly. Nevertheless, concrete\nconstructions consistent with the observed world frequently lead to observable\nremnants, i.e., new particles or features that are apparently accidental\nconsequences of the ultraviolet theory and that are typically not motivated by\nspecific shortcomings of the standard models of particle physics or cosmology.\nFor example, moduli, axions, large extended gauge sectors, additional $Z'$\ngauge bosons, extended Higgs/Higgsino sectors, and quasi-chiral exotics are\nextremely common. They motivate alternative cosmological paradigms and could\nlead to observable signatures at the LHC. Similar features can emerge in other\nstandard model extensions, but in the stringy case they are more likely to\noccur in isolation and not as part of a more complete TeV-scale structure.\nConversely, some common aspects of the infinite \"landscape\" of field theories,\nsuch as large representations, are expected to be very rare in the string\nlandscape, and observation of features definitively in the swampland could lead\nto falsification. In this article, common stringy remnants and their\nphenomenology are surveyed, and implications for indirectly supporting or\ncasting doubt on string theory are discussed.",

    "summary": "Chiral electroweak anomalies predict fermion interactions that violate baryon\n($B$) and lepton number ($L$), and can be dressed with large numbers of Higgs\nand gauge bosons. The estimation of the total $B+L$ violating rate from an\ninitial two-particle state --potentially observable at colliders-- has been the\nsubject of an intense discussion, mainly centered on the resummation of boson\nemission, which is believed to contribute to the cross-section with an\nexponential function of the energy, yet with an exponent (the \"holy-grail\"\nfunction) which is not fully known in the energy range of interest. In this\narticle we focus instead on the effect of fermions beyond the Standard-Model\n(SM) in the polynomial contributions to the rate. It is shown that $B+L$\nprocesses involving the new fermions have a polynomial contribution that can be\nseveral orders of magnitude greater than in the SM, for high centre-of-mass\nenergies and light enough masses. We also present calculations that hint at a\nsimple dependence of the holy grail function on the heavy fermion masses. Thus,\nif anomalous $B+L$ violating interactions are ever detected at high-energy\ncolliders, they could be associated with new physics.",

In this\ncontext, also the discrepancy in the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon can\nbe interpreted as a sign of lepton flavour universality violation. Here we\ndiscuss how these hints for new physics can also be explained by introducing\nleptoquarks as an extension of the Standard Model. Indeed, leptoquarks are good\ncandidates to explain the anomaly in the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon\nbecause of an $m_{t}/m_{\\mu}$ enhanced contribution giving correlated effects\nin $Z$ boson decays which is particularly interesting in the light of future\nprecision experiments.",

    "summary": "In view of the recent experimental results on exclusive semileptonic $B$\nmeson decays showing sizable departure from Standard Model prediction of lepton\nflavor universality, and keeping ongoing and proposed non-standard Higgs\nsearches in mind, we explore the charged current heavy flavor observables\n($\\mathcal{R}_{D^{(*)}}$, $\\mathcal{R}_{J/\\psi}$), among other $b\\to c\\ell \\nu$\ntransitions, in the presence of a relevant scalar current effective new physics\noperator. We do this under the constraints of the $B_c$ lifetime and predicted\nbounds on the branching fraction of $B_c \\to \\tau \\nu$ decay. We show the\nallowed parameter space in terms of the real and imaginary parts of the\ncorresponding Wilson coefficients for such interactions. Under the light of\nobtained results, we look into the prospect of two classes of models, rendering\nthe Wilson coefficients real and complex respectively. We use two new physics\nmodels: (a) the Georgi-Machacek (GM) model, and (b) one Leptoquark (LQ)\nscenario. While there have been several heavy flavor analyses on possible LQ\nmodels till date, semileptonic $B$ decays have never been studied in the GM\nmodel to the best of our knowledge. We show that constraints from $b\\to c\\ell\n\\nu$ on GM parameters are consistent with other flavor constraints on the model\nif we drop the Babar results. Including those disfavors the model by more than\n$3\\sigma$. On the other hand, one benchmark LQ scenario, which gives rise to a\nsingle scalar current effective interaction, is still allowed within $68\\%$\nconfidence level, albeit with a shrunk parameter space.",

We report on new measurements of the\nproduction of identified particles and their dependence on multiplicity and\n$\\sqrt{s}$. Latest results for light flavor hadrons, comprising $\\pi^{\\pm}$,\n$\\mathrm{K}^{\\pm}$, ${\\rm p}(\\rm \\bar{p})$, single-strange\n($\\mathrm{K_{S}^{0}}$, $\\bar{\\Lambda}$, and $\\Lambda$), multi-strange\n($\\Xi^{-}$, $\\overline{\\Xi}^{+}$, $\\Omega^{-}$, and $\\overline{\\Omega}^{+}$)\nparticles as well as resonances ($\\mathrm{K^{*0}}$,\n$\\mathrm{\\overline{K}^{*0}}$, $\\phi$), are presented for $\\sqrt{s}~=~5.02, 7$,\nand 13 TeV. The measured minimum bias $p_{\\rm T}$ spectra and yields were\ncomplemented with multiplicity-dependent measurements for single- and\nmulti-strange hadrons at $\\sqrt{s}~=~7$ and $\\sqrt{s}~=~13$ TeV. Results are\ncompared to measurements at lower $\\sqrt{s}$ as well as to those in proton-lead\nand lead-lead (Pb-Pb) collisions, respectively at $\\sqrt{s}_{\\rm NN}~=~5.02$\nTeV and $\\sqrt{s}_{\\rm NN}~=~2.76$ TeV. The results unveil intriguing\nsimilarities among collision systems at different $\\sqrt{s}$. The production\nrates of strange hadrons are found to increase more than those of non-strange\nparticles, showing an enhancement pattern with multiplicity which does not\ndepend on the collision energy. These yield ratios take values which are alike\nfor small systems at comparable multiplicities and show smooth evolution with\nmultiplicity across all collision systems. Although the multiplicity dependence\nof spectral shapes can be qualitatively described by general-purpose Monte\nCarlo (MC) event generators, the evolution of yield ratios is barely (or not)\ncaptured by MC model predictions.",

Using 10000\ninitial and final profiles generated from 2+1-d relativistic hydrodynamics\nVISH2+1 with MC-Glauber initial conditions, we train a deep neural network\nbased on stacked U-net, and use it to predict the final profiles associated\nwith various initial conditions, including MC-Glauber, MC-KLN and AMPT and\nTRENTo.

    "summary": "We show that fragmentation of the inflaton into long-lived spatially\nlocalized oscillon configurations can lead to copious production of black\nholes. In a single-field inflation model primordial black holes of sublunar\nmass can form, and they can account for all of the dark matter. We also explore\nthe possibility that solar-mass primordial black holes, particularly relevant\nfor gravitational wave astronomy, are produced from the same mechanism.",

    "summary": "Entropy, dimensions and other multifractal characteristics of multiplicity\ndistributions of relativistic charged hadrons produced in ion-ion collisions at\nSPS energies are investigated. The analysis of the experimental data is carried\nout in terms of phase space bin-size dependence of multiplicity distributions\nfollowing the Takagi's approach. Yet another method is also followed to study\nthe multifractality which, is not related to the bin-width and (or) the\ndetector resolution, rather involves multiplicity distribution of charged\nparticles in full phase space in terms of information entropy and its\ngeneralization, R\\'{e}nyi's order-q information entropy. The findings reveal\nthe presence of multifractal structure-- a remarkable property of the\nfluctuations. Nearly constant values of multifractal specific heat, 'c'\nestimated by the two different methods of analysis followed indicate that the\nparameter 'c' may be used as a universal characteristic of the particle\nproduction in high energy collisions. The results obtained from the analysis of\nthe experimental data agree well with the predictions of Monte Carlo model\nAMPT.",

    "summary": "Over the past couple of years we have had significant progress in determining\nlong-distance singularities in gauge-theory scattering amplitudes of massless\nparticles beyond the planar limit. Upon considering all kinematic invariants\nmuch larger than the QCD scale, the singularities factorise into universal soft\nand jet functions, leaving behind a finite hard-interaction amplitude. Such\nfactorization can now be implemented in full to three loops for arbitrary\nscattering processes of massless partons. In particular, the soft anomalous\ndimension for a general configuration of $n$ coloured particles was computed to\nthis order, where it displays for the first time non-dipole interactions that\ncorrelate the colour and kinematic degrees of freedom of three and four\nparticles. In parallel, there has been progress in understanding amplitudes and\ntheir singularities in special kinematic limits, such as collinear limits of\nmulti-leg amplitudes and the high-energy limit in $2\\to 2$ scattering. These\nrelate respectively to different factorization properties of gauge-theory\namplitudes. In this talk I describe the state of the art and illustrate the\ninterplay between the analysis of the singularities for general kinematics and\nthe properties of amplitudes in special kinematic limits.",

In this paper, we tried to\nunderstand the phenomenology of dark matter in light of very well understood\nproperties of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropy. To connect these\ntwo, inflation and its subsequent evolution known as reheating phase play the\nimportant role. Following previous analysis, we first established one to one\ncorrespondence between the CMB power spectrum and the reheating temperature\nassuming perturbative reheating scenario. Further by incorporating a possible\ndark matter candidate through radiation annihilation process during reheating\nand the current value of dark matter abundance, we constrain the dark matter\nparameter space through the inflationary power spectrum for different\ninflationary models.",

We obtain updated ranges for its parameters both in a\nhalo-independent approach and adopting a truncated Maxwellian for the WIMP\nvelocity distribution constructing approximate frequentist confidence intervals\nfrom an effective chi-square including, among others, the latest experimental\nconstraints from XENON1T, PANDAX-II, SuperCDMS and CDMSlite. In the\nhalo-independent analysis we have implemented the dependence on the WIMP\nvelocity distribution through a step-wise parameterization of the halo\nfunction. For the calculation of the profile likelihood we used a Markov Chain\nMontecarlo generator that required a large number of evaluations of the\nexpected rates. To reduce computational time we introduced expected rates\nexpressions suitable for a fast evaluation through tabulation and\ninterpolation. Our frequentist analysis confirms the present viability of the\npSIDM scenario as a possible explanation of the DAMA effect. In terms of the\nWIMP mass $m_{\\chi}$ and of the mass splitting $\\delta$ we find the 1-sigma\nranges $\\mbox{12.5 GeV} \\le m_{\\chi}\\le \\mbox{15.7 GeV}$, $\\mbox{22.1 keV} \\le\n\\delta \\le \\mbox{26.1 keV}$ for the halo--independent analysis and $\\mbox{11.4\nGeV} \\le m_{\\chi}\\le \\mbox{13.6 GeV}$, $\\mbox{24.4 keV} \\le \\delta \\le\n\\mbox{27.0 keV}$ for the Maxwellian case.

For the decays $B_s \\to e \\tau, \\mu \\tau$ these\nbranching ratios are of order $10^{-10}$ and $10^{-9}$ respectively. The\npredicted branching ratios will be usefull in the current and future\nexperimental searches for these decays.",

    "summary": "In view of the high luminosity phase of the LHC (HL-LHC) to start operation\naround 2026, a major upgrade of the tracker system for the ATLAS experiment is\nin preparation. The expected neutron equivalent fluence of up to 2.4 * 1e16 1\nMeV neq./cm2 at the innermost layer of the pixel detector poses the most severe\nchallenge. Thanks to their low material budget and high charge collection\nefficiency after irradiation, modules made of thin planar pixel sensors are\npromising candidates to instrument these layers. To optimise the sensor layout\nfor the decreased pixel cell size of 50 * 50 {\\mu}m2, TCAD device simulations\nare being performed to investigate the charge collection efficiency before and\nafter irradiation. In addition, sensors of 100-150 {\\mu}m thickness,\ninterconnected to FE-I4 read-out chips featuring the previous generation pixel\ncell size of 50 * 250 {\\mu}m2, are characterised with testbeams at the CERN-SPS\nand DESY facilities. The performance of sensors with various designs,\nirradiated up to a fluence of 1 * 1e16 neq./cm2, is compared in terms of charge\ncollection and hit efficiency. A replacement of the two innermost pixel layers\nis foreseen during the lifetime of HL-LHC. The replacement will require several\nmonths of intervention, during which the remaining detector modules cannot be\ncooled. They are kept at room temperature, thus inducing an annealing. The\nperformance of irradiated modules will be investigated with testbeam campaigns\nand the method of accelerated annealing at higher temperatures.",

    "summary": "It is known that the imposition of a class of residual $Z_2\\times Z_2$\nsymmetries on the neutrino mass matrix $M_\\nu$ and a residual symmetry $Z_n$\n($n\\geq 3$) on the Hermitian combination $M_lM_l^\\dagger$ of the charged lepton\nmass matrix leads to a universal prediction of vanishing Dirac CP phase\n$\\delta$ if these symmetries are embedded in $\\Delta(6 n^2)$ groups and if the\nleptonic doublets transform as a 3 dimensional irreducible representation of\nthe group. The Majorana phases remain arbitrary but they can also be determined\nin $\\Delta(6 n^2)$ by imposing generalized CP symmetry (GenCP) consistent with\nthe $\\Delta(6 n^2)$ group. We investigate the effects of adding general\nperturbations on these predictions assuming that perturbations break the\n$Z_2\\times Z_2$ symmetry completely but preserve GenCP. It is found that if the\nresidual symmetries predict the tri-bimaximal mixing (TBM) among leptons and\nspecific CP conserving values for the Majorana phases then addition of the\nabove perturbations always lead to a neutrino mass matrix invariant under the\n$\\mu$-$\\tau$ reflection symmetry in the flavour basis with the result that\nperturbations turn the vanishing $\\delta$ into maximal value $\\pm\n\\frac{\\pi}{2}.$ One gets non-vanishing but generally large $\\delta$ if the\npredicted zeroeth order mixing deviates from TBM and/or the predicted Majorana\nphases are non-trivial. We systematically investigate effects of perturbations\nin such situations and work out the predicted $\\delta$ for four of the lowest\n$\\Delta(6 n^2)$ groups with $n=2,4,6,8.$",

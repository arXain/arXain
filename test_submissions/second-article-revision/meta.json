	"authors" : "Hopper, David; Train, Peter",
	"abstract" : "We propose a formal theory of quantum \textit{Super-Duper} neural networks as a means for their embedding into a block chain. Graph theory, quantum field theory, a roll of a die, and some luck allows us to show that a qubit distributed across the network can undergo rapid adiabatic transport between eigenstates. Discussions pertaining to this system as the one and only (OaO) quantum computing architecture are discussed.",
